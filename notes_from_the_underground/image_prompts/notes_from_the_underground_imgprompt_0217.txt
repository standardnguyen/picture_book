In an intense Expressionist illustration set in a dimly lit room of the St. Petersburg apartment, the Dreamer, a young man with unkempt hair and a haunted expression, stands facing Apollon, an elderly man exuding an air of stern authority and contempt. The Dreamer's stance is one of defiance and inner turmoil, his hands clenched at his sides as he meets Apollon's piercing gaze with a mixture of fear and resilience. Apollon, with a cold, calculating stare, looms over the Dreamer, his features twisted in a cruel smirk that accentuates the psychological torment he inflicts. The room is filled with oppressive shadows, casting a sense of foreboding over the scene. The color palette consists of deep, shadowy hues of black and gray, emphasizing the psychological power play between the characters. The composition captures the palpable tension and emotional manipulation as Apollon's severe stare becomes a tool for subtle torture, highlighting the psychological torment and silent battles within the confined space.
