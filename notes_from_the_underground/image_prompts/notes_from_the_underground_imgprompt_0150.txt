In an Expressionist-style illustration depicting a luxurious but somber living room in an affluent St. Petersburg apartment. Zverkov, a figure exuding arrogance and superiority, reclines on a lavish lounge with one foot casually resting on a round table. His posture exudes nonchalant confidence, his features displaying a hint of disdain. The room is adorned with opulent furnishings, hinting at wealth and status, but also a sense of emptiness and loneliness. The background features dim lighting and shadows, casting a subdued atmosphere over the scene. The colors are rich and deep, with a palette of dark blues and hints of gold, emphasizing the contrast between luxury and emotional detachment. The composition focuses on Zverkov, capturing his sense of casual power and detached demeanor in the opulent yet melancholic setting.
