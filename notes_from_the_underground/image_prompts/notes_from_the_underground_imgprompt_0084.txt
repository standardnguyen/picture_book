In an evocative Expressionist style illustration set in the heart of a bustling St. Petersburg square, a captivating scene unfolds. Olga, a young woman with delicate features betraying a sense of vulnerability and self-consciousness, stands with her posture slightly tense, her hands tightly clasped in front of her. Facing her is Andrei, a young man emanating an air of quiet contemplation and resignation, his eyes reflecting a mix of understanding and empathy. The square is teeming with blurred figures moving about, highlighting the feeling of isolation within the crowded space. The color palette consists of muted tones of grey and blue, with flickering gas lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the internal struggle and conformity portrayed in the moment.
