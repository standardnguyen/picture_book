An evocative Expressionist scene set within a dimly lit room on the fourth storey of a house in Five Corners, St. Petersburg. The room is sparsely furnished, with fading wallpaper and worn furniture, embodying a sense of frugality and sallowness. Anton Antonitch, a middle-aged man with a weary expression and a posture that exudes routine, sits on a leather couch, engaged in conversation with a grey-headed gentleman over a table cluttered with paperwork. The room is illuminated by a single flickering lamp, casting long shadows and enhancing the atmosphere of stagnation and bureaucracy. Two young girls, aged thirteen and fourteen, with snub noses and mischievous expressions, stand in a corner whispering and giggling, adding a touch of discomfort and shyness to the scene. The aunt, a figure with a warm yet distant gaze, pours out tea while observing the interactions with a hint of disapproval. The color palette is dominated by muted browns and greys, with subtle hints of faded blues and yellows, capturing the dreary ambiance and social dynamics within the room. The overall composition conveys a sense of stifled conversation, social hierarchy, and the protagonist's inner turmoil amid the mundane rituals of social interactions.
