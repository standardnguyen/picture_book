In an expressive Expressionist style illustration set against the dreamlike backdrop of St. Petersburg's white nights, a captivating scene unfolds on a wide embankment beside a gently flowing river. Ekaterina, a young woman with wistful eyes and a sense of longing, stands with her back slightly turned, her hands clasped near her chest, capturing a mix of solitude and contemplation. Facing her is Nikolai, a young man exuding a sense of introspection and quiet sincerity, his eyes reflecting a depth of emotion and understanding. The background is filled with blurred silhouettes of passersby, enhancing the isolation of the pair in the serene landscape. The scene is depicted in a soft palette of yellows and grays, with the falling wet snow adding a sense of melancholy and nostalgia, symbolizing the poignant storytelling unfolding in the moment.
