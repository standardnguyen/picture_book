In an Expressionist-style illustration set in a dimly lit and claustrophobic room in St. Petersburg, the Dreamer is depicted in a state of inner turmoil and humiliation. The room is small and stuffy, adorned with faded wallpaper peeling at the edges. The Dreamer, a young man with disheveled hair and a haunted expression, paces back and forth frantically, his gestures exaggerated with frustration and self-loathing. His clothes are rumpled, and sweat stains spread across his shirt, symbolizing his unease. The waiter, a shadowy figure in the background, casts a watchful eye on the scene, his features obscured in the dim lighting. The color palette is muted, with shades of gray and sickly yellows, evoking a sense of decay and despair. The Dreamer's movements are distorted and frantic, capturing his internal struggle and the weight of his humiliating thoughts.
