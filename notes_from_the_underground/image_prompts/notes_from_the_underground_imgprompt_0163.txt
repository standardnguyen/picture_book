In a striking Expressionist illustration, set amidst the snow-covered streets of St. Petersburg engulfed in the eerie glow of a winter night, the Dreamer, a man with a tortured expression and disheveled appearance, stands outside a sledge, hands clenched by his sides, head bowed in shame. The sledge driver, a weathered figure with a mixture of concern and bewilderment etched on his face, looks on in silent observation, adding to the atmosphere of tension and contemplation. The scene is illuminated by the dim light of flickering street lamps, casting elongated shadows on the snow-covered ground. The colors are muted with subtle shades of cool blues and grays dominating the scene, evoking a sense of isolation and introspection. The Dreamer's posture conveys a deep inner conflict and emotional turmoil, his shame palpable in the somber ambiance of the snowy night.
