In the Expressionist style, a chaotic and intense scene unfolds on the snowy, dimly lit streets of St. Petersburg. The Dreamer, a disheveled young man with a pained expression and wild gestures, confronts Simonov, a figure exuding disdain and pitilessness as he throws money towards the Dreamer. The background is filled with disarray - remnants of a broken dinner, spilled wine, and cigarette ends strewn on the floor, evoking a sense of decadence and despair. The waiter, with an inquisitive gaze, observes the unfolding drama. The colors are dark and moody, with shades of deep reds and browns accentuating the turmoil in the scene. As the Dreamer spirals into desperation, his inner turmoil is palpable, conveyed through his frenzied movements and anguished expression. The setting of the snowy streets adds to the isolation and desolation of the moment, with the snowfall symbolizing a sense of impending doom and lost opportunities.
