In an evocative Expressionist scene set in a dimly lit government office in St. Petersburg, a man named Nikolai, with weary eyes and a tension in his shoulders, sits hunched over his desk covered with paperwork. His expression conveys a deep sense of discontent and disillusionment with his official work. Despite his inner turmoil, Nikolai maintains a composed exterior, a facade of indifference upheld by the need for a salary. The room is filled with shadowy corners and flickering candlelight, casting eerie shadows that mirror Nikolai's internal conflict. The color palette consists of muted greys and blues, symbolizing the monotony and oppressive nature of bureaucracy. The scene captures Nikolai's suppressed emotions and the suffocating atmosphere of the office, hinting at the intricate layers of psychological turmoil beneath his composed facade.
