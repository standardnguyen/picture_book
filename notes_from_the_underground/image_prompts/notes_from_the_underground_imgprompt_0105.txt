In an intense Expressionist scene set in a dimly lit office space with shadows cast by a single flickering lamp, we see the Dreamer, a young man with disheveled hair and a look of desperation on his face, standing nervously before Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, his immediate superior. Anton Antonitch is depicted as a grave and judicious figure, seated behind a cluttered desk with a furrowed brow and a hint of skepticism in his eyes. The room is filled with ominous shadows and a heavy, stifling atmosphere, symbolizing the weight of the Dreamer's request. The Dreamer's hands are clasped tightly together, conveying his inner turmoil and anxiety. Anton Antonitch's expression transitions from surprise to contemplation as he considers the Dreamer's plea for a loan. The colors are muted and somber, with shades of grey and dark blues dominating the scene, creating a sense of tension and apprehension. The composition emphasizes the power dynamics at play, with the Dreamer seeking financial assistance in a moment of desperation, captured with raw emotion and stark contrasts.
