In a cluttered and dimly lit apartment in St. Petersburg, the Dreamer paces back and forth anxiously, his face a mix of anticipation and dread. He is a young man with disheveled hair and a mismatched outfit, the American leather sofa behind him spilling out its stuffing in a disarrayed fashion. The room exudes neglect, with tattered furnishings and an overall air of dilapidation. The Dreamer's expression transitions from worry to determination as he envisions the impending arrival of Liza, a young woman of delicate features and a sense of innocence about her. She is depicted with eyes wide with curiosity and a touch of apprehension, embodying a blend of admiration and uncertainty. Behind the Dreamer and Liza, Apollon lurks in the background, a stern figure with a haughty demeanor, ready to pounce on any opportunity to be rude. The atmosphere is tense, with shadows dancing across the cracked walls and worn carpet, symbolizing the inner turmoil and conflict within the Dreamer. The scene captures a moment of vulnerability and self-realization, as the Dreamer grapples with the fear of being exposed and the prospect of wearing the mask of deception once more in front of Liza, evoking a sense of raw emotion and impending confrontation.
