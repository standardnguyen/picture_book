In an Expressionist style illustration set in a dimly lit room with a single flickering candle casting eerie shadows, a solitary figure, Ivan, stands with a slight hunch, facing a cracked mirror. Ivan, a man with disheveled hair and a haunted gaze, embodies the internal turmoil and introspection described in the text. His features are angular and exaggerated, reflecting the weight of his consciousness and inner conflict. Ivan's hands grip the edges of the worn mirror, his reflection distorted and fragmented, symbolizing his struggle with identity and self-awareness. The color palette consists of deep blues and sickly greens, enhancing the sense of unease and illness that plagues Ivan. The room exudes a claustrophobic atmosphere, mirroring the confines of his mind and the burden of excessive consciousness.
