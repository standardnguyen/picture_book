In a vivid Expressionist style portrayal set against the enigmatic backdrop of St. Petersburg's dimly lit streets, an intense scene unfolds near a desolate alley. Yelena, a young woman with haunting eyes reflecting a deep sense of loneliness and introspection, stands with her back slightly turned, her hands clenched by her sides, embodying a mix of desolation and self-imposed solitude. Across from her stands Kirill, a young man with a brooding expression and a demeanor of social detachment, his gaze fixed on the ground, exuding an aura of isolation and inner turmoil. The background is filled with shadowy figures passing by, enhancing the sense of alienation surrounding the duo. The color palette consists of muted blues and grays, with sporadic glimmers of dim street lights casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the melancholic and detached essence of their existence.
