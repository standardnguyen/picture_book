In an Expressionist style illustration set in a dimly lit, cramped room, a solitary figure named Alexei stands near a worn-out writing desk. Alexei is depicted as a man with a furrowed brow, his eyes filled with a mixture of self-blame and inner turmoil. His features are angular and exaggerated, portraying the weight of his consciousness and the burden of his thoughts. Alexei's hands are clenched into fists by his sides, his body slightly hunched over in a posture of defeat. The room is filled with shadows that dance around him, symbolizing the darkness of his self-blame. The color palette consists of deep, somber blues and dull grays, emphasizing the sense of hopelessness and frustration that engulfs him. The walls of the room are lined with peeling wallpaper, reflecting the decay and desolation of Alexei's mind.
