In a gripping Expressionist portrayal set within the confining walls of a dimly lit underground room in St. Petersburg, the Dreamer, a young man with disheveled hair and a haunted look in his eyes, is captured in a moment of intense internal conflict and spiteful actions. His movements are frantic and agitated, as he rushes around the claustrophobic space, peeking through a crack in the screen with a sense of suffocating oppression. The Dreamer's expression is a mix of desperation and resentment, his hands nervously tapping on the screen in a bid to escape the oppressive presence of the woman, depicted as a shadowy figure behind the veil. The woman, clad in attire suggesting a desire for escape, exudes a sense of resignation and heaviness in her gaze, as she prepares to depart, her eyes meeting the Dreamer's with a weighty silence. The room is characterized by distorted angles and elongated shadows, enhancing the sense of unease and turmoil that permeates the scene. Soft hues of muted blues and grays dominate the color palette, reflecting the emotional intensity and brooding atmosphere of the underground setting. The composition captures the moment of cruel action driven by spite, as the Dreamer furtively places money in the woman's hand before retreating in haste, his face a mask of conflicted emotions and self-awareness.
