In an evocative Expressionist portrayal set on a mist-shrouded embankment along the Neva River in St. Petersburg, the Dreamer, a young man with a pensive expression and tousled hair, gazes intently at Nastenka, a tall and strong-looking woman with a kind yet solemn countenance. Nastenka stands with hands clasped near her heart, her eyes reflecting a sense of both innocence and depth. The background is enveloped in a surreal twilight glow, with mist swirling around them, creating an ethereal atmosphere. Shadows cast by the dimly glowing street lamps lengthen across the cobblestones, emphasizing the somber yet hopeful mood of the scene. The colors are a harmonious blend of soft blues and grays, with hints of warm light illuminating the characters, capturing the mix of simplicity, good-naturedness, and gravitas in Nastenka's presence.
