In an evocative Expressionist portrayal set within a dimly lit room of a St. Petersburg apartment, the solitary figure of the Dreamer, a man with tousled hair and a weary expression, is depicted sitting by a small window overlooking the city. His posture is one of introspection and seclusion, huddled in a worn armchair that symbolizes his desire for isolation and escape from the world. The room is sparsely furnished, with faded wallpaper and a single flickering candle casting eerie shadows. Apollon, an elderly man with a stern countenance and precise movements, is shown in the background, symbolizing an unwelcome intrusion into the Dreamer's private sanctuary. The Dreamer's gaze is averted from Apollon, emphasizing his inner detachment and longing for solitude. The color palette consists of muted shades of gray and brown, evoking a sense of somber solitude and confinement within the confined space. The composition captures the Dreamer's internal struggle and his deep-seated need for seclusion, juxtaposed with the relentless presence of Apollon, embodying a poignant representation of solitude amidst unwelcome company.
