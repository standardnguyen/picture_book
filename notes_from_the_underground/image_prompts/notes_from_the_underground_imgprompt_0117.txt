In a brooding Expressionist composition set within Simonov's dimly lit apartment in St. Petersburg, the scene unfolds with dramatic tension. The room is cluttered with worn furniture and dimly glowing lamps, casting elongated shadows that dance across the walls. The three figures, depicted with sharp angles and intense expressions, stand or sit around a small table littered with empty glasses and scattered papers. The Dreamer, a man of disheveled appearance and a haunted gaze, enters the room with a mix of apprehension and resignation, his posture reflecting a sense of defeat. Simonov, with a weary yet calculating expression, gestures towards the newcomer with a subtle air of superiority. The two old schoolfellows, portrayed with sneers and dismissive glances, exude an aura of disdain towards the Dreamer, their body language conveying a palpable sense of exclusion and condescension. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and greys, with stark contrasts and harsh lighting that accentuate the oppressive atmosphere of the room. The composition captures the palpable tension and social hierarchy at play, emphasizing the Dreamer's sense of alienation and insignificance in the face of his former peers' success and camaraderie.
