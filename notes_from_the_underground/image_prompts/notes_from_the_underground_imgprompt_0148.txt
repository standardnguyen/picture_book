In the Expressionist-style illustration, the scene unfolds in a dimly lit, smoke-filled tavern in St. Petersburg. The Dreamer, a young man with disheveled hair and wild eyes, stands unsteadily by a table, his hand gripping a glass of vodka. His expression is a mix of desperation and defiance as he addresses Zverkov, a figure with a look of haughty arrogance, sitting opposite him with a sneer on his face. Trudolyubov, a man with a bullish demeanor and clenched fists, slams his hand down on the table in anger, his face contorted with fury. Ferfitchkin, a character with a sly grin and exaggerated features, cowers slightly in his chair, his eyes wide with anticipation of conflict. The room is filled with shadowy figures in the background, their faces obscured, adding to the sense of foreboding and tension in the air. The color palette features deep reds and shadows, reflecting the simmering emotions of the characters and the undercurrent of violence ready to erupt.
