In an Expressionist-style illustration set in a dimly lit and opulent dining hall in St. Petersburg, the scene captures a moment of humiliation and isolation experienced by the Dreamer. The room is adorned with elaborate tapestries and flickering candlelight, casting dramatic shadows around the figures within. The Dreamer, a young man with hunched shoulders and a crestfallen expression, sits alone at a table set with fine china and silverware, his eyes downcast in shame. Zverkov, a figure exuding false superiority, stands at the head of the table regaling the assembled guests with a grandiose tale, his posture haughty and a smirk playing on his lips. Ferfitchkin, a man with a shrill, mocking laugh, leans back in his chair with exaggerated gestures of approval. The other guests, generals, colonels, and kammer-junkers, surround the table, their faces contorted in laughter and indifference. The Dreamer's clothing appears disheveled, highlighting the yellow stain on his knee, a stark contrast to the luxurious setting. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and muted golds, enhancing the atmosphere of despair and alienation.
