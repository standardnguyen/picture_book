In an Expressionist-style illustration set on a snowy, dimly lit street in St. Petersburg, the Dreamer, a disheveled young man with a furrowed brow and determined eyes, throws himself into a roughly made sledge. The little shaggy piebald horse, covered in snow and visibly unwell, stands stoically as wisps of steam rise from its body. The scene is filled with a sense of urgency and determination as the Dreamer, with a mix of desperation and resolve, clenches his fists in a gesture of determination. The background is shadowy, with dimly lit street lamps casting long shadows and creating an atmosphere of mystery and tension. The color palette features shades of icy blues and grays, evoking a feeling of cold desolation and inner turmoil. The composition focuses on the contrast between the Dreamer's physical actions and his internal struggle, highlighting the intense emotions and sense of impending reckoning in the moment.
