In a vibrant Expressionist composition set against the backdrop of a countryside Russian estate during the golden hour, Nastenka, a young woman with flowing chestnut hair and melancholic yet hopeful eyes, stands beside the Dreamer, a young man with a tender expression and hands extended in a comforting gesture. Nastenka is dressed in a simple yet elegant gown, her posture reflecting a mix of contemplation and longing. The Dreamer, with tousled dark hair and furrowed brows, gazes wistfully at Nastenka, his features softened by a hint of a smile, embodying empathy and reassurance. The background features a lush garden with blooming flowers and tranquil ponds, illuminated by the warm hues of the setting sun, casting long shadows and creating an aura of serenity. The scene is awash in soft pinks, oranges, and yellows, symbolizing the fleeting beauty and delicate balance of happiness and sorrow in the journey of love and marriage.
