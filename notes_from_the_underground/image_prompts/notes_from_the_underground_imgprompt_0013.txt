In an Expressionist style illustration set in a dimly lit laboratory, a figure named Anton is depicted standing next to a bubbling retort filled with swirling, mysterious liquids. Anton is portrayed as a man of disheveled appearance, with unkempt hair and an intense gaze that hints at his acute consciousness. His hands are clenched into fists by his sides, and his posture conveys a sense of inner conflict and introspection. The laboratory is filled with shadows and distorted glassware, creating a surreal and unsettling atmosphere. The color palette consists of dark greens and murky yellows, enhancing the sense of mysticism and ambiguity in the scene. The retort emits a faint, eerie glow, casting dramatic shadows that dance across Anton's face, symbolizing the duality of his existence as both man and mouse.
