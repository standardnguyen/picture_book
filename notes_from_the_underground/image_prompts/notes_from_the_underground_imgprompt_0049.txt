In a dynamic Expressionist composition set in a dimly lit, cluttered laboratory filled with scientific equipment and mysterious contraptions, two figures engage in a heated debate. The Scientist, a middle-aged man with intense eyes and disheveled hair, gestures emphatically with one hand, his expression a mix of skepticism and curiosity. Beside him, the Inquirer, a younger man with a thoughtful expression and a hint of defiance, stands with arms crossed, challenging the Scientist's assertions. The room is bathed in a sickly green light emanating from a bubbling flask, casting eerie shadows on the characters. Books and papers are strewn across the cluttered desk, with equations and diagrams hinting at the quest for a mathematical formula of desire. The atmosphere crackles with intellectual tension, conveying the complexity and uncertainty of human choice and the limits of scientific explanation.
