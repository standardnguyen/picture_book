In an Expressionist style illustration set on a desolate and dimly lit street in St. Petersburg, a figure named Ivan is depicted huddled in a dark alleyway, consumed by shame, anguish, and resentment. Ivan is portrayed with a gaunt appearance, his features distorted by inner turmoil, his hands clutching at his chest as if trying to contain the overwhelming emotions within. His eyes are wide with despair and self-loathing, haunted by imaginary torment. The background is shrouded in shadows, with flickering lights casting eerie, elongated silhouettes that seem to taunt and accuse. The alley is filled with symbolic elements of Ivan's self-destructive thoughts, such as twisted reflections and ghostly whispers, highlighting his descent into a realm of paranoia and unforgiving self-punishment. The color palette consists of deep blacks and murky grays, with occasional flashes of crimson to represent the self-inflicted wounds of vengeance. The atmosphere is charged with an oppressive sense of inevitability and inner conflict, capturing the psychological torment of Ivan as he grapples with his fantasies of revenge and the bitter realization of their futility.
