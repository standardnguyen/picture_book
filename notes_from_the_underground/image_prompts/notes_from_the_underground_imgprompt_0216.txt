In an intense Expressionist scene set within a claustrophobic, cluttered room in a typical St. Petersburg apartment, the Dreamer, a man with disheveled hair and a look of seething frustration, stands opposite Apollon, an elderly man exuding a mix of pride and disdain. The Dreamer's face contorts with anger and determination, his clenched fists trembling with suppressed rage. Apollon, with his dignified yet disdainful demeanor, stands tall with a haughty expression and folded arms, projecting an aura of superiority and entitlement. The room is filled with scattered sewing materials, unfinished clothing pieces, and dimly lit candles, casting eerie shadows on the walls that mirror the turbulent emotions between the characters. The color palette consists of stark contrasts between dark shades of gray and muted browns, emphasizing the oppressive and antagonistic atmosphere suffusing the room. The composition focuses on the power struggle and emotional tension between the Dreamer and Apollon, capturing the moment of internal conflict and resolution as the Dreamer grapples with his desire for retribution against Apollon's unyielding pride.
