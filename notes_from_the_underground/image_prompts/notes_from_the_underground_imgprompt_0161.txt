In a chaotic and intense scene at the St. Petersburg posting station, set against the backdrop of a hazy, pre-dawn sky, the Dreamer, a man with wild eyes and disheveled hair, lunges towards Zverkov, a figure of arrogance and disdain. The Dreamer's face contorted with fury, he reaches out to grab Zverkov's leg while Zverkov, wearing a tailored coat, recoils in shock. The atmosphere crackles with tension as onlookers watch in bewilderment and alarm. The Dreamer's mouth is open in a primal snarl, teeth bared, as he prepares to bite Zverkov's hand. Zverkov's expression registers a mix of disbelief and outrage at this sudden and brazen attack. The setting is dimly lit by flickering lanterns, casting elongated shadows and enhancing the dramatic nature of the confrontation. The colors are bold and stark, with deep reds and dark blues dominating the scene, symbolizing the escalation of the conflict and the impending climax of the Dreamer's desperate actions.
