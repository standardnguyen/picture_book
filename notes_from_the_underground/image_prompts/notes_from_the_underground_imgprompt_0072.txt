The background features shadowy figures walking past, emphasizing the solitude of the pair in the bustling city. Colors blend deep purples and somber grays, illuminated by soft lantern light casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the juxtaposition of despair and fleeting hope. This evocative illustration captures the essence of conflicting desires and the struggle between acceptance and defiance, portrayed through the poignant gestures and expressions of the characters.
