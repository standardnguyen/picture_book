In an intense and emotionally charged Expressionist scene set against the backdrop of a desolate St. Petersburg street at night, the Dreamer, a man with a look of desperation etched on his face, sits hunched in a horse-drawn sledge, hands clenched into fists, eyes filled with a mix of defiance and resignation. The sledge-driver, a weathered peasant figure with a fur hat, turns back in surprise and anger as the Dreamer impulsively punches him on the back of the neck. The tension between them is palpable, heightened by the falling wet snow casting a dreary and somber veil over the scene. The street lamps, flickering dimly like mournful torches, illuminate the snowflakes cascading around them, adding a sense of isolation and impending doom to the moment. The Dreamer's disheveled appearance, with snow melting on his coat and cravat, underscores his state of inner turmoil and reckless abandon as he hurtles towards a fateful and inevitable confrontation that looms ahead.
