In an Expressionist-style illustration set in a dimly lit and smoky room in St. Petersburg, the Dreamer is depicted in a moment of despair and rejection. The Dreamer, a young man with disheveled hair and despair etched on his face, stands in the foreground with outstretched hands, pleading with Simonov, a figure with a look of disdain and aloofness. Simonov, with unkempt hair and vacant eyes, embodies a sense of detachment and indifference. Trudolyubov, a flushed and boisterous man, is seen in the background, raising a glass in celebration. Zverkov, exuding arrogance and confidence, is surrounded by a group of blurred figures, their expressions mocking and dismissive. The room is filled with overturned wine glasses and scattered papers, symbolizing chaos and discord. The color palette is dark and moody, with shades of deep reds and browns, reflecting the tension and despair in the scene. The composition focuses on the contrast between the Dreamer's vulnerability and the harsh rejection of his plea, capturing the deep sense of isolation and dejection.
