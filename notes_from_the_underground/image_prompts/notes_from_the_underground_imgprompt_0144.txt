In an Expressionist-style illustration set in a crowded and dimly lit café in St. Petersburg, the scene captures a moment of tension and confrontation among the characters. The café is filled with buzzing activity, with patrons engaged in hushed conversations and sly glances. The Dreamer, a young man with a mix of defiance and irritation on his face, stands with a slightly raised hand to emphasize his point, while Ferfitchkin, a man with a flushed and angry expression, leans forward aggressively, his features contorted in fury. Zverkov, a figure exuding false authority, sits at a table with a steely gaze, attempting to quell the escalating conflict. Simonov, a character with a look of disdain and boredom, observes the interaction with a sense of detached amusement. Trudolyubov, a sturdy man with a stern expression, stands up from his chair, pointing a finger towards the Dreamer, demanding order. The café's atmosphere is filled with a sense of claustrophobia and unease, intensified by the smoky haze and dim lighting. The color palette is dominated by deep browns and murky greens, reflecting the simmering anger and frustration in the air.
