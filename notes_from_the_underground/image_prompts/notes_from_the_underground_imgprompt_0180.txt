In an Expressionist portrayal set against the backdrop of a candle-lit, musty attic in a dilapidated St. Petersburg building, Liza, a young woman with tear-glazed eyes and a weary yet understanding expression, sits on a weathered trunk, her hands folded gently on her lap. The Dreamer, a brooding figure with furrowed brows and a conflicted gaze, kneels beside her, his demeanor a mix of tenderness and melancholy. The room is sparsely furnished, with peeling wallpaper and a solitary flickering candle casting elongated shadows, emphasizing the somber mood of the conversation. Soft hues of gray and muted browns envelop the scene, with hints of warm light illuminating Liza's downcast face, symbolizing the emotional weight of familial love and jealousy. The intimate moment captured between Liza and the Dreamer conveys a sense of introspection and attachment, echoing the delicate intricacies of paternal affection and possessive longing.
