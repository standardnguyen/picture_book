In an Expressionist-style illustration set in a dimly lit dining room of a lavish hotel in St. Petersburg, the scene captures a moment of awkwardness and humiliation. The room is adorned with opulent decorations, but a sense of unease hangs in the air. The Dreamer, a young man with a furrowed brow and tense posture, is seated at a table that remains unset, his eyes reflecting a mix of confusion and embarrassment. His figure is depicted in shadows, emphasizing his internal turmoil. The room is filled with a dim, flickering light from candles and lamps, casting elongated shadows across the plush carpet. The waiters, dressed in crisp uniforms, move about the room with a sense of urgency, yet their expressions reveal a hint of disdain towards the Dreamer. In the background, two gloomy and sullen figures sit at separate tables, their faces obscured by shadows, adding to the atmosphere of silent tension and social discomfort. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and rich golds, creating a somber yet elegant tone that captures the Dreamer's feelings of shame and isolation.
