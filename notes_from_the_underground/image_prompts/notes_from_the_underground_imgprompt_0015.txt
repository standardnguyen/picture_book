In an Expressionist style illustration set on the misty banks of the Neva River in St. Petersburg during the White Nights, two figures stand facing each other amidst a surreal twilight glow. The Dreamer, a young man with a gentle and caring demeanor, is depicted with a bittersweet smile on his face, exuding a sense of longing and compassion. His eyes hold a mixture of understanding and sorrow as he gazes at Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes that show a blend of relief and sorrow. Nastenka is shown with her hands clasped near her heart, slightly turned away from the Dreamer, conveying a sense of inner turmoil and vulnerability. The background features blurred figures that enhance the isolation of the pair, symbolizing their shared but separate emotional landscapes. The scene is bathed in soft blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting long shadows, capturing both hope and melancholy in the air. The atmosphere is ethereal and mystical, evoking a sense of deep-seated memories and unspoken desires lingering beneath the surface.
