The illustration captures a poignant moment of tension and revelation, set against the lush backdrop of Roulettenburg, where the complexities of love and deception intertwine in the characters' expressions and body language.

In the foreground, **Mr. Astley** is depicted sitting at a small, elegantly adorned table, his demeanor calm and contemplative. His features are refined and slightly angular, with a well-groomed beard and deep-set eyes that reflect both wisdom and weariness. He wears a tailored suit in dark charcoal, with a crisp white shirt that peeks out, giving him an air of sophistication. His hands rest on the table, fingers steepled as he appears to be contemplating his next words, conveying a sense of burden from the knowledge he carries. The soft illumination from a nearby lamp casts gentle shadows on his face, accentuating the lines of concern etched on his forehead.

Opposite him sits the protagonist, whose expression is one of frustration and disbelief. His dark hair is tousled, suggesting a sense of inner turmoil, and his attire—an elegant yet understated navy suit—contrasts with the more flamboyant styles of others in the casino. His brow is furrowed, and he leans forward, his intense gaze fixed on Astley, demanding answers. One hand rests on the table, the other clenched into a fist, the tension radiating from his posture. His body language is magnified, illustrating his emotional conflict, making him seem both vulnerable and passionate in this moment of confrontation.

In the middle ground, **Mlle. Polina** is depicted standing slightly off to the side, her expression one of concern and anticipation. She is dressed in an exquisite gown of deep burgundy, adorned with intricate lace details that flow elegantly around her. Her hair is styled in soft waves, with delicate curls framing her face, creating an air of charm and grace that stands in stark contrast to the tension between the two men. Her gaze is fixed on Astley, reflecting a mix of trust and doubt as she processes the implications of their conversation. Her posture is poised yet betrays a hint of anxiety, as her fingers lightly clutch the folds of her gown.

In the background, the setting of the casino envelops the characters with a sense of grandeur and opulence. The roulette table gleams with vibrant colors of green and gold, and a few blurred figures of elegantly dressed patrons mingle, their laughter and chatter forming a cacophony that contrasts sharply with the serious dialogue unfolding at the table. Ornate chandeliers hang from the ceiling, casting warm light that dances across the luxurious interior, creating an atmosphere of both allure and tension.

The color palette is rich, with bold reds, deep greens, and shimmering golds that not only enhance the opulence of the casino but also underscore the emotional intensity of the scene. The Expressionist style manifests in exaggerated forms—particularly in the characters’ expressions and body language—dramatizing their internal conflicts and the intertwining themes of love, betrayal, and despair that Dostoyevsky masterfully navigates in this narrative. This illustration encapsulates the essence of the moment, drawing viewers into the intricate emotional landscape of "The Gambler."
