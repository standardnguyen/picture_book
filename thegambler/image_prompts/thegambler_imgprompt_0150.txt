The illustration vividly captures the opulence of a luxurious hotel suite in a European spa, focusing on the Grandmother, who commands the scene with her imposing presence. 

In the foreground, **Madame Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha**, the Grandmother, is depicted with a regal demeanor, seated in a plush, richly upholstered armchair that showcases an array of deep burgundy and gold colors. She wears a sumptuous black silk gown that drapes gracefully around her, adorned with intricate golden lace detailing around the cuffs and neckline. Her hair, grey and elegantly coiled, is adorned with a delicate, lace mobcap that contrasts with the richness of her attire. Her large, expressive eyes appear slightly narrowed in shrewd appraisal as she surveys her surroundings, framed by high cheekbones that not only suggest her age but also her vitality. One hand rests on the arm of the chair, while the other holds a jeweled fan—this subtle gesture exudes authority and style.

Beside her stands the **landlord**, an elderly man of slight build and balding head, dressed in a formal, outdated suit with a faint sheen that signifies his respectability. His face is marked by a sense of reverence mixed with slight apprehension, indicative of the Grandmother’s commanding presence. He holds a hotel register in one hand, poised to write down her name with a look of both pride and anxiety while glancing sideways at her, ensuring he is meeting her expectations. His posture is slightly hunched like someone accustomed to bowing slightly out of polite habit.

In the background, each of the four lavishly appointed rooms is visible through open doorways. The setting is excessively ornate—walls adorned with artistic wallpaper of intricate floral designs in soft gold and cream tones, golden sconces casting a warm, inviting glow. An extravagant chandelier hangs above, prisms catching the light beautifully. Fine furnishings, including a gilded mirror and a grand piano draped with silk fabric, reflect wealth and sophistication. 

Through one of the doorways, glimpses of **the maid** can be seen, dressed in a classic black dress with white accents, attending with a slight bow, holding a tray of refreshments, her expression one of dutiful service. Another doorway reveals a large bathroom, decorated with polished marble and extravagant fixtures, emphasizing the suite’s previous occupant, a Grand Duchess.

The overall color palette is dominated by rich reds, deep greens, and touches of gold, creating a sense of luxury and excess. The exaggerated forms and vibrant hues within the scene lend an Expressionist quality, reflecting the emotional weight of status and wealth that envelops the Grandmother. The juxtaposition of her strong personality against the soft elegance of her surroundings immerses the viewer in the world of Dostoyevsky's narrative, embodying the themes of social hierarchy and the perception of importance that characterize this moment in "The Gambler." The dynamics within the room suggest an air of superiority matched with an undercurrent of societal expectation, inviting the viewer to explore the intricate layers of character and setting.
