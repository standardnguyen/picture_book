The illustration captures a tense and pivotal moment in a lavish dining setting, reflecting the urgency and emotional turmoil of the conversation among the characters amidst the grandeur of Roulettenburg.

In the foreground, **the protagonist** is depicted with an intense expression of frustration and desperation, his features sharply etched, emphasizing his agitation. He is of medium height, with tousled dark hair that suggests both youth and inner conflict. He wears a simple yet elegantly cut dark suit that fits him well but lacks the flamboyance of the aristocracy surrounding him, conveying his outsider status. His brow is furrowed, eyes wide with disbelief, and his mouth is half-open in protest as he bangs his fist upon the polished wooden table, causing the tableware to rattle. His clenched fist is central to the image, the knuckles pale with pressure, representing his emotional upheaval.

To his right, **Mlle. Zelma** is depicted with an expression of alarm and concern, caught off guard by his outburst. Her attire is opulent—an elaborate, flowing gown in shades of sapphire that shimmers under the soft candlelight, accented with intricate lace and beadwork. Her hair is styled elegantly, piled high with curls, and a few loose strands cascade down her neck—contributing to her air of refined beauty. Her delicate hand is raised to her mouth in surprise, highlighting her femininity while showcasing her vulnerability in this moment of escalating tension.

On the opposite side of the table sits **the General**, a figure of imposing stature, exuding authority with an air of restraint. He is dressed in a richly adorned military uniform, complete with gold epaulettes and a high collar, his dark hair meticulously groomed. His face carries a mixture of irritation and a hint of stricken disbelief as he stares at the protagonist, his arms crossed over his chest, creating a barrier of authority. The sharp lines of his jaw and the intense gaze from his deep-set eyes imply a struggle between duty and personal feelings, as if he is grappling with the implications of the protagonist's outburst.

In the background, **the waiter** stands startled, a look of concern etched on his face. His white waistcoat is crisp, but the slight tremor in his hands contrasts sharply with the luxurious setting. The restaurant around them is bustling, with elegantly dressed patrons immersed in their conversations, oblivious to the tension at this particular table. The soft glow of flickering candles casts dancing shadows across rich, ornate wallpaper of deep burgundy and gold, enhancing the opulence of the setting.

The overall color palette is dominated by deep reds, golds, and blues, creating a rich, warm atmosphere while heightening the emotional stakes present in the scene. The exaggerated features of the characters and the way they interact with one another—leaning in, tense, and expressive—evoke a strong sense of drama reminiscent of Expressionist artistry. This moment of conflict reflects darker themes of social expectations, secrets, and the risk of scandal, capturing the essence of Dostoyevsky's narrative with elegance and intensity.
