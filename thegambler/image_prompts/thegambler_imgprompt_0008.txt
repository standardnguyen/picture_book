The illustration vividly captures a moment of serendipity as Alexei Ivanovich encounters the enigmatic Englishman for the third time in the bustling environment of the Roulettenburg casino, foreshadowing the intertwining fates of the characters. 

In the foreground, Alexei stands with a mix of surprise and intrigue. He is depicted with slightly tousled hair and a pale complexion that conveys his inner turmoil. His dark suit, although well-fitted, bears signs of wear, subtly indicating his precarious financial status. His wide eyes express a sense of astonished recognition, while his brow is furrowed in contemplation, encapsulating the depth of his emotions in this unexpected encounter. 

Opposite him is the Englishman, dressed in a vibrant tweed suit that stands out amid the opulence of the casino. His attire, featuring a stylish waistcoat and a subtly patterned cravat, evokes a sense of sophistication and ease. His complexion is fair, with light, tousled hair that gives him an affable and approachable demeanor. The Englishman’s expression is one of amused curiosity, with a slight smirk playing at the corners of his mouth, suggesting a familiarity and lightheartedness towards Alexei’s evident unease. His posture is relaxed, with one hand casually tucked into his pocket, projecting an air of confidence in this lively setting.

The background is a vivid ambiance of the Roulettenburg casino, filled with colorful characters engaged in various activities, creating an energetic and slightly chaotic atmosphere. The air is alive with chatter and laughter, with gleaming chandeliers casting warm, glowing light over richly-dressed patrons. Tables adorned with plush velvet fabrics display roulette wheels and stacks of chips, while elegantly clad croupiers move gracefully through the scene. 

Scattered amongst the crowd are figures in extravagant dresses and sharp suits, their bright colors and opulent accessories enhancing the theatricality of the setting. A few women can be seen arrayed in flowing gowns of deep emerald, ruby, and gold, with pearls gleaming on their delicate necks, while men sport lavish waistcoats and meticulously styled hair. 

The expressions of the onlookers reflect a range of emotions—from excitement and longing to envy and despair—illustrating the diverse motivations that drive the patrons in the casino. These figures swirl around Alexei and the Englishman, their faces slightly distorted in dramatic fashion to emphasize the fervor and intensity of the gambling culture. 

Above, the ceiling of the casino is adorned with painted frescoes, with swirling patterns that allude to the themes of fate and chance, as the colors blend into one another, enhancing the expressionist style of the illustration. 

Overall, the composition employs vivid colors—rich reds, vibrant greens, and deep blues intertwined with gold accents—to evoke a sense of grandeur and emotional depth. The exaggerated forms and frenetic energy of the scene serve to express the inner struggles of the characters, inviting viewers to reflect on the theme of chance and the unpredictable nature of fortune that permeates Dostoyevsky’s narrative.
