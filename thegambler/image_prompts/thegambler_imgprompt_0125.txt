The illustration encapsulates a moment of tension and desperation in the vibrant yet oppressive atmosphere of the Casino in Roulettenburg as **Mlle. Zelma** finds herself alone amidst the glitz and trepidation of her gambling surroundings.

In the foreground, **Mlle. Zelma** is portrayed with a defiant yet vulnerable expression as she stands at the roulette table. Her long, wavy hair, dark as midnight, cascades dramatically around her face and shoulders, held partly in place by ornate jeweled clips that hint at her former glory. She wears a striking gown of deep emerald green, rich with satin textures and elaborately adorned with golden embroidery that swirls down towards the hem. The gown fits snugly at the bodice, accentuating her figure, but begins to fray slightly, painting a picture of her declining fortunes. Her eyes are wide with a mix of hope and desperation, and the corners of her mouth carry a faint yet determined smile—she is resolute in her request to the Baron, despite her dwindling resources.

To her side, **the Baron Burmergelm** is depicted as a figure of stern disapproval. He stands rigidly, sharply dressed in a finely tailored charcoal suit that contrasts starkly with the vibrant surroundings. His angular face is marked by a thin mustache that accentuates his frown, and his cold blue eyes scrutinize Zelma with a dismissive gaze. His posture is stiff, arms crossed, conveying both a sense of authority and disdain, yet there is an underlying hint of intrigue as he finds himself reluctantly drawn into her drama.

The background features the casino’s lavish interior, filled with players immersed in their own worlds. The roulette wheel stands prominently, drawing the eye with its polished surface reflecting the golden light of the chandeliers hanging above. The tables are strewn with colorful chips and playing cards, the green felt marked by the frantic energy of gamblers. Opposite Zelma, a group of characters—fellow players caught in their own aspirations—are depicted with exaggerated expressions of anxiety and concentration, their fashions ranging from extravagant to slightly disheveled, underscoring the chaotic atmosphere.

As the scene unfolds, a sense of impending doom hangs in the air. The decor reflects a lavish splendor that masks the underlying desperation—gilded mirrors, plush red carpeting, and ornate drapes create a beautiful yet suffocating environment. The chiaroscuro effects emphasize the emotional weight of the moment, with exaggerated shadows accentuating Zelma’s isolation amid the buzzing crowd that seems to either ignore or judge her.

The overall color palette is rich and evocative, dominated by deep greens, golds, and shadows that contrast with bursts of vibrant red from the players’ attire. The expressionist style is evident not only in the characters’ heightened emotions but also in the dramatic shapes and forms of their bodies, which seem to twist and turn in line with the chaos of fate and fortune. This illustration offers a vivid representation of Mlle. Zelma's precarious position in the social hierarchy of Roulettenburg and encapsulates the themes of ambition, discontent, and the unforgiving nature of gambling, resonating with Dostoyevsky’s exploration of human desires and despair.
