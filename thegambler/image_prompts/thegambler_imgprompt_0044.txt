The illustration captures a tense and emotionally charged moment between Alexei Ivanovich and Polina Alexandrovna in a dimly lit room that hints at their turbulent relationship. 

In the foreground, Alexei stands with a posture that conveys both yearning and despair. He is dressed in a fitted dark gray suit, which is slightly rumpled, suggesting a restless night and the weight of his unrequited feelings. His tousled dark hair falls softly over his forehead, and his deep-set blue eyes reflect a mixture of hope, desperation, and bewilderment as he gazes at Polina. His features are sharp yet melancholy, with a faint shadow creeping under his eyes, symbolizing his inner turmoil.

Polina, just a few steps away, is portrayed in a flowing, white gown that seems ethereal, contrasting with the darker tones of Alexei's attire. Her dark hair is elegantly styled, cascading over her shoulders, adding to her aura of sophistication. She holds herself with an air of detachment, her expression cool and contemplative, with a subtle curl of disdain playing on her lips. Her piercing blue eyes, however, betray a flicker of interest mixed with contempt, as she gazes at Alexei with an expression that communicates her awareness of his feelings while simultaneously dismissing them.

The background depicts a richly decorated room, characterized by heavy draperies in deep burgundy and gold accents, enhancing the atmosphere of opulence tinged with emotional void. Soft, warm light spills from a nearby chandelier, casting intricate shadows that seem to dance around the characters, emphasizing the tension in the air. The contours of the furniture are exaggerated, almost looming, which metaphorically reflects the emotional barriers between them.

Additionally, a vase of wilting flowers sits on a table adjacent to them, symbolizing the fading beauty of their connection and infusing the scene with a sense of melancholy. The petals, in hues of pale pink and white, droop slightly, mirroring the fraught emotions and the complexity of their relationship.

In this Expressionist composition, the interplay of light and shadow, along with the characters' exaggerated yet grounded forms, vividly communicates the disconnect between Alexei’s ardent passion and Polina’s aloofness, inviting the viewer to delve into the psychological depths of their intertwined fates within Dostoyevsky’s narrative. The overall palette uses rich colors to evoke the intensity of their emotional exchange while preserving a sense of drama and longing.
