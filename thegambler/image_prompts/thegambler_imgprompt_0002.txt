The illustration captures a striking moment in which Polina Alexandrovna and Alexei Ivanovich's complex emotions are laid bare in a dimly lit corridor of the villa, enhancing the tense atmosphere of their relationship. 

In the foreground, Polina stands poised, her slender figure draped in an ethereal gown that hints at both sophistication and fragility. The fabric appears almost luminescent, contrasting sharply with the oppressive darkness looming around her. Her auburn hair cascades in soft waves, framing her delicate features that convey a mixture of concern and detachment. Her brows are slightly furrowed, and her lips are pursed, suggesting an inner conflict as she glances back at Alexei, her expressive, deep-set eyes flickering with unspoken questions and expectations.

Alexei, positioned slightly behind her, embodies a figure caught in the throes of anxiety and yearning. His attire is that of a respectable tutor—well-fitted but slightly disheveled, revealing his inner turmoil. A tailored jacket, now slightly wrinkled, hangs on his frame; his shirt collar stands askew, and his necktie hangs loosely. With tousled dark hair and a pale complexion, his wide eyes reflect deep emotional distress and lingering hope. The angle of his body leans forward, showcasing his eagerness to understand her abrupt departure, hands partially outstretched as if he wants to bridge the gap between them.

The background features dim, muted hues, with deep shadows creeping in from the edges, creating a sense of entrapment. The corridor walls are lined with faded wallpaper that echoes the themes of decay and decline, further mirroring the characters’ emotional states. An ornate mirror hangs crookedly on one wall, its reflective surface hinting at the duality of their feelings—what they present and what they conceal.

Overall, the scene radiates an expressionist intensity, with exaggerated emotional depth captured in the characters’ postures and facial expressions, inviting the viewer to delve into the intricate dynamics of love, longing, and uncertainty that Dostoyevsky so intricately weaves throughout the narrative.
