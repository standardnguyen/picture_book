The illustration depicts a tense, emotionally charged moment in a verdant park setting, capturing the internal struggles and unspoken affections of the characters involved.

In the foreground, Mr. Astley is portrayed as a tall, slender man in his late twenties, radiating an aura of shyness and modesty. His attire is somewhat formal but understated, consisting of a dark gray suit that fits him well, yet hangs slightly loose, suggesting his discomfort in social situations. His hair is dark and slightly tousled, hinting at his distracted state of mind. His face is pale and angular, with deep-set blue eyes that convey both longing and hesitation; they are fixed on Polina with an intensity that borders on desperation, reflecting his unspoken affection. He stands with a rigid posture, one hand nervously fiddling with the edge of his coat, while his other hand is awkwardly tucked into his pocket—a physical manifestation of his desire to disappear even as he yearns to be near her.

Behind him, nestled among the vibrant greenery, Polina Alexandrovna is depicted sitting gracefully on a park bench. She is dressed in a flowing white gown adorned with delicate floral patterns, exuding a fresh and ethereal quality. Her hair is a rich chestnut color, styled in loose waves that cascade around her shoulders, framing her radiant face. Her features are soft, with large, expressive brown eyes that occasionally glance toward Mr. Astley, hinting at a complex mix of curiosity and ambivalence about his presence. There’s a slight smile playing on her lips, tinged with an air of mystery, as if she knows more about Mr. Astley’s feelings than she lets on.

Flanking the area, a lush garden teems with vibrant flowers in hues of red, yellow, and blue, symbolizing the chaotic emotions at play within the scene. The blossoms, exaggerated in size and color, enhance the atmosphere of longing and beauty, while their bright colors contrast with the more muted tones of the characters’ outfits. The sunlight filters through the leaves above, casting dappled shadows on the ground that dance around Polina, creating a sense of warmth and intimacy, yet also of fleeting moments that echo the nature of their interaction.

In the background, the bustling amusement of the casino can faintly be seen through the trees, represented as an opulent structure adorned with gold accents and vibrant banners. The sounds of laughter and music subtly permeate the air, a reminder of the world outside their isolated moment and the distractions that linger in their minds. A playground of merriment, it emphasizes the dichotomy between the lively exterior and the profound internal emotional conflicts faced by the characters.

The overall color palette is vivid yet carefully balanced, utilizing rich greens and warm yellows to imbue the scene with energy while contrasting with the more subdued hues of Mr. Astley’s suit and Polina’s dress. The brush strokes are expressive and fluid, echoing the emotions and tensions within the scene, enhancing the Expressionist style. The exaggerated forms of the flowers and the characters’ postures create a dynamic interplay that invites viewers to delve deeper into the complexities of desire, modesty, and the weight of unspoken affections in Dostoyevsky's narrative.
