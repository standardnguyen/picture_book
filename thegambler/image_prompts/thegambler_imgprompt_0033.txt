The illustration depicts Alexei Ivanovich standing at the roulette table, embodying the emotional disarray that grips him as he contemplates his next move. His youthful face is illuminated by a mix of warm and harsh lighting, casting deep shadows under his high cheekbones and drawing attention to the anxious furrow on his brow. He has striking deep blue eyes that reflect a sense of confusion and distraction, suggesting he is lost in a whirlpool of thoughts and feelings rather than focusing on the game before him. 

Alexei is dressed in a dark charcoal gray suit that appears slightly rumpled, as if he has been wrestling not just with the fabric but with his own internal chaos. His dark hair is tousled yet stylish, hinting at both his youthful vigor and his current state of mental tumult. One hand is raised hesitantly, one finger brushing against his chin in a contemplative pose, while his other hand hovers uncertainly over a pile of colorful chips on the table, showcasing how detached he feels from the action around him.

Surrounding Alexei, the casino is alive with a dynamic crowd captured in vivid colors and exaggerated forms that convey an atmosphere teetering on the brink of chaos. The patrons around the roulette table are dressed in sumptuous gowns and tailored suits, their expressions a blend of eagerness and desperation. Women swirl around in flowing dresses of deep crimson, royal blue, and shimmering gold, their laughter ringing out yet juxtaposed with the tension of Alexei’s disconnection. Men, clad in imposing suits, lean forward with animated gestures, embodying the thrill of risk-taking, their faces animated yet slightly distorted to express the spectrum of emotions they experience—hope, greed, and fear.

The roulette table itself is the dark heart of the scene, dramatically lit with glimmering reflections that enhance its allure. The wheel spins in motion, a blend of rich colors captured in mid-action, symbolizing the unpredictability of fate. The chips, in vibrant hues of red, black, and green, seem to pulse with energy, exaggerated in size as they celebrate the concept of chance that Alexei grapples with.

The background of the casino is filled with extravagant chandeliers hanging above, their crystalline surfaces catching the flickers of light and casting rainbows across the room, creating an otherworldly effect that underscores the intoxicating atmosphere. Shadows loom in the corners, suggesting the ominous weight of unseen stakes and secrets held within these walls.

Overall, the composition gives a sense of frenetic energy—a vibrant carnival of human emotion—while simultaneously capturing Alexei’s overwhelming sense of absence in this colorful world. This moment encapsulates the dissonance between the vivacity of the gambling environment and Alexei’s distracted, almost ghostly presence, ultimately reflecting Dostoyevsky's exploration of the inner turmoil that accompanies the thrill of chance and the human condition.
