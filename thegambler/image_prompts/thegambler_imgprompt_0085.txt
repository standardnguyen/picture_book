The illustration captures a poignant moment of longing and introspection against the vibrant backdrop of Roulettenburg's park, infused with an Expressionist style that conveys the emotional turmoil of the young Russian man. 

In the foreground, the young man, Alexei Ivanovich, is depicted with a gaunt, angular face, reflecting his inner conflict and desperation. His deep-set hazel eyes, luminous with a mix of regret and yearning, are directed toward Polina, who is slightly distanced from him. His tousled dark hair falls over his forehead, adding to his disheveled appearance, while his pale complexion is highlighted by a flush of anxiety. He is dressed in a slightly rumpled burgundy waistcoat over a white shirt, signaling a man caught between his social aspirations and chaotic emotional state. His posture is slightly hunched, as though the weight of his impulsive actions is heavy on his shoulders, conveying a sense of defeat and contemplation.

Polina, at the center of the scene, appears elegant yet aloof as she walks away toward the hotel with a handful of children trailing behind her. She wears a flowing, light-colored dress that billows gently in the breeze, highlighting her graceful movements. Her face is adorned with delicate features, yet her expression is inscrutable, marked by a faint frown and an air of indifference toward Alexei. Dark hair is styled simply yet stylishly, framing her face and enhancing her enigmatic presence. As she ascends the staircase, her body language suggests both authority and detachment, making her the object of Alexei's fixation and burgeoning despair.

The children accompanying her are portrayed with lively energy, their youthful faces animated with curiosity and mischief. They wear bright, colorful clothing that contrasts sharply with the more muted tones of Alexei's attire, capturing the innocence and joyfulness of childhood. Their presence further emphasizes Alexei’s solitude, as they engage with each other, oblivious to the emotional tension between him and Polina.

In the background, the lush greenery of the park merges into a dense forest, rich with varying shades of green, brown, and deep shadows. The trees, exaggerated in height and breadth, loom overhead, creating a sense of isolation around Alexei, who appears dwarfed by the natural surroundings, amplifying his sense of vulnerability. 

The portico of the hotel is faintly visible in the distance, painted in soft pastels that contrast with the darker tones of the foliage, suggesting the vibrant social life that Alexei feels disconnected from. The sky above is a dramatic swirl of colors—deep blues and hints of orange—indicating either twilight or early evening, adding to the atmospheric tension of the moment.

The overall color palette is rich and expressive, utilizing deep hues that evoke a sense of emotional depth and resonance. The scene is filled with dramatic contrasts and exaggerated forms that align with the Expressionist style, encapsulating the complex interplay of desire, despair, and social dynamics that Dostoyevsky vividly portrays in "The Gambler." The illustration encapsulates a moment of internal conflict and emotional resonance, making it a powerful visual manifestation of Alexei’s turbulent relationship with Polina and his struggles with his own identity.
