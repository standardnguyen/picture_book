The illustration captures a chaotic yet vivid moment of emotional turmoil within the opulent confines of a hotel in Roulettenburg, focusing on **Mlle. Zelma** as she grapples with despair and loss, enveloped by the surrounding atmosphere of luxury and drama.

In the foreground, **Mlle. Zelma** is depicted in a fit of frenzy, her expression one of pure anguish. Her long, dark hair is disheveled, cascading wildly around her shoulders, suggesting a spiraling descent into despair. She wears an ornate gown, intricately detailed with lace and shimmering fabrics, now torn and frayed at the edges, which accentuates her emotional state. The rich crimson of her dress contrasts sharply with the opulent surroundings, symbolizing her inner turmoil amidst the façade of luxury. Her delicate hands, adorned with rings, are raised to her face as if to scratch at her skin in desperation; her beautifully manicured nails are emphasized, stained with smudged red polish, illustrating the contrast between her beauty and her chaotic spirit. The flush on her cheeks and wide, distraught eyes hint at the depth of her despair, while tears glisten, capturing the light and reflecting her broken state.

Standing to the side, **the Polish count** is depicted with an air of fascination and concern. He possesses an aristocratic profile, with sharply defined features and a well-groomed mustache that accentuates his high cheekbones. Dressed in a fine, tailored suit adorned with embellishments, he embodies confidence contrasted with the chaos surrounding him. His posture is one of attentive grace; one hand is raised in a calming gesture towards Zelma, while the other rests on his hip, suggesting both intrigue and a slight detachment from the emotional turmoil he witnesses. His dark eyes are wide, reflecting both admiration and disbelief at the dramatic spectacle before him.

The hotel's interior serves as a lavish backdrop, characterized by opulent decorations such as gilded mirrors, plush velvet drapery in hues of deep emerald and royal blue, and ornate chandeliers that cast a soft, warm light across the scene. The floors are covered with intricate patterned carpets that enhance the richness of the setting, while the wallpaper features extravagant designs that frame the chaos unfolding within. The blurred silhouettes of other patrons in the background depict them as mere spectators to the emotional drama, their forms elongated and distorted slightly to emphasize the focus on Zelma’s emotional breakdown.

The color palette is dominated by vibrant reds and deep golds, with the exaggerated expressions of the characters set against a backdrop of swirling colors, suggesting the turbulence of the moment. The contrast of light and shadow adds a depth of emotion to the scene, highlighting Zelma's despair and the count's curiosity.

This illustration encapsulates the themes of emotional crisis and the complexity of human relationships within the context of Dostoyevsky's narrative, visually representing the tumultuous experience of Mlle. Zelma and the fleeting connections that arise amidst her despair.
