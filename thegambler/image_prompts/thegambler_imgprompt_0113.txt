The illustration vividly portrays a moment of simmering tension and resolute defiance as **Alexei Ivanovich** descends a grand staircase, glancing back at the **Frenchman** who remains in the dimly lit upper chamber. The scene is infused with Expressionist style, characterized by bold colors and exaggerated features that deepen the emotional complexity of the characters' exchange.

At the forefront, **Alexei** is depicted in mid-step, his figure leaning slightly forward with an air of determination, yet his posture reflects an underlying turmoil. His dark, tousled hair prominently frames his angular face, wild yet poignant, suggesting his inner chaos. His expressive hazel eyes shine with a mix of defiance and confusion, portraying the weight of his emotions in this moment of confrontation. Dressed in a slightly wrinkled white shirt and an open dark grey coat, his clothing hangs loosely on his frame, accentuating a sense of disarray that echoes the turmoil within. One hand clutches the railing of the staircase, knuckles white with tension, while his other hand is lifted and poised, as if gesturing towards the upper chamber in accusation.

In the background, the **Frenchman** stands in the shadows of the upper landing, partially illuminated by a streak of light that creates a dramatic contrast against the surroundings. His slender figure is dressed in a meticulously tailored black suit, sharply contrasted by the muted, rich colors of the salon. The Frenchman’s face, with its delicate yet cunning features, is adorned with a mocking smile that hints at both arrogance and amusement. His slicked-back hair shines under the chandelier's light, enhancing his poised demeanor. He gazes down at Alexei with narrowed eyes, radiating an air of superiority as he leans casually against the ornate bannister. 

The staircase itself is an architectural marvel, with grand, sweeping curves that lead downward, adding to the illusion of motion and descent into tension. The walls of the salon are draped in deep emerald green with gilded moldings, their richness offset by the warm glow of the chandelier hanging overhead. Shadows dance upon the surface, emphasizing the dramatic atmosphere. The ornate decor—ornamental pillars, plush fabric on the furniture, and an elaborate carpet—evokes the opulence of the environment, contrasting sharply with the emotional discord between the characters.

The overall color palette features deep greens, dark blues, and subtle golds that enhance the interplay of light and shadow, while also amplifying the psychological tension present in the scene. The distortion of perspective in the staircase creates a sense of depth that further emphasizes Alexei’s isolation as he confronts his adversary, symbolizing the internal struggle he faces in the context of his gambling addiction and tumultuous relationships.

This illustration encapsulates the moment of unresolved conflict and emotional turmoil, inviting viewers into the intricate dynamics of power, competition, and desperation that Dostoyevsky masterfully explores in "The Gambler."
