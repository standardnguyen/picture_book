The illustration captures a moment of palpable tension and emotional complexity as Alexei Ivanovich contemplates Polina Alexandrovna's manipulative intentions regarding roulette.

In the foreground, Alexei is depicted with an expression of inner conflict and subjugation. He has a slender frame, dressed in a slightly frayed black suit that emphasizes both his refinement and the weight of his distress. His angular face is marked by sharp cheekbones, and his deep-set blue eyes glimmer with a mix of longing and confusion. His hair is dark and tousled, reflecting the chaos of his thoughts. He stands with his arms crossed defensively, shoulders slumped, conveying the sense of being trapped in a web of emotions he cannot escape. His posture suggests both an inability to assert himself and a desperation to understand Polina's true intentions.

Polina, positioned a few steps away, is portrayed in an ethereal gown of deep crimson satin, which flows elegantly around her and seems to catch the dim light of the room. The fabric shimmers subtly, enhancing her commanding presence. Her long, dark hair cascades in soft waves down her back, framing her face, which is a striking combination of beauty and aloofness. She gazes down at Alexei with an enigmatic smile, her eyes reflecting a blend of amusement and disdain. This expression hints at her awareness of the power she holds over him, and her indifference is palpable. The delicate lines of her features are framed by a hint of shadow that adds depth, emphasizing her role as both a muse and a tormentor in Alexei's life.

The background presents a lavish, dimly lit casino, richly decorated with ornate detailing reminiscent of opulence and excess. The walls are draped in heavy burgundy velvet, blending with the overall warm, rich color palette. Flickering candlelight casts dancing shadows throughout the room, creating a dramatic interplay of light and darkness that mirrors the emotional turmoil within the scene. 

A roulette wheel looms in the background, symbolizing the game that has ensnared both Alexei and Polina in a complex dance of chance and manipulation. The figures of other gamblers, faded and distorted, surround them, suggesting the larger world of risk and desire in which they are entrenched. Their faces reflect various emotions—greed, excitement, anxiety—further enhancing the atmosphere of tension and desperation pervading the moment.

In this Expressionist composition, the exaggerated forms and vivid colors work together to convey the psychological weight of their relationship, illustrating Polina's calculated disregard for Alexei's feelings and his resulting helplessness. The scene captures a crucial moment of inner conflict within Alexei, inviting the viewer to delve deeper into the emotional landscape of Dostoyevsky's narrative.
