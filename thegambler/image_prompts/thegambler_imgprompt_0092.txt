The illustration captures a tense and emotionally charged moment set within the opulent surroundings of a dimly-lit hotel suite, echoing the complexities of human relationships and the finality of severed ties. The scene is rendered in a vivid Expressionist style, emphasizing the emotional weight and high stakes of the exchange.

In the foreground, a figure stands resolutely, giving the impression of both determination and melancholy. Alexei Ivanovich is depicted with angular features, his deep-set hazel eyes reflecting a conflicting mixture of resignation and a flicker of hope. His tousled, dark hair frames his face messily, enhancing the sense of disarray in his life. He wears a slightly rumpled greyish waistcoat over a crisp white shirt, the collar loosened for comfort, with a hint of a burgundy cravat peeking out, hinting at his social aspirations. His expression conveys deep sadness as his gaze is cast downward, focused on the money in his outstretched hand that signifies both compliance and loss. The motion of his hand reveals the heaviness of this symbolic transaction, as if releasing the last ties connecting him to the General.

Opposite Alexei, the General stands as a formidable figure, embodying authority and finality. He is portrayed as stout, with a thick mustache and a furrowed brow that accentuate his stern expression. Clad in an elaborate military uniform adorned with medals, which glint ominously in the dim light, his stature exudes confidence and power. His arms are crossed firmly over his chest, creating a barrier between him and Alexei, as if he is preparing to sever any remaining connection. His heavy-set features are marked by anger and disappointment, echoing a mixture of duty and personal grievance, and an air of disdain radiates from his posture.

In the background, the lavish hotel suite is filled with grandeur, showcasing intricately patterned wallpaper in rich, dark hues of crimson and gold, complemented by heavy drapes that hang luxurious yet oppressive. Decorative pieces, such as gilded frames with portraits of illustrious figures and plush furnishings that hint at wealth, surround the characters, creating an atmosphere that feels both inviting and stifling.

The lighting in the room is deliberately dramatic, casting deep shadows that play across the characters' faces, heightening the emotional tension in the air. The color palette employs intense shades—densely saturated reds, deep golds, and earthy browns—that saturate the scene with a palpable sense of emotional gravity and the weight of societal expectations.

This illustration encapsulates the moment of transaction that symbolizes a profound emotional severance, embodying themes of loss, resignation, and the complexities of human relationships that Dostoyevsky intricately explores in "The Gambler." The visceral imagery and exaggerated forms invite the viewer into this poignant moment of parting, where personal destiny collides with the harsh truths of social obligation.
