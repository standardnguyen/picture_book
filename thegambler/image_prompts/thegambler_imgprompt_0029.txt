The illustration captures a moment of intense emotional conflict as Alexei Ivanovich stands at the center of a richly detailed casino environment, his inner turmoil vividly reflected in his expression and posture. 

In the foreground, Alexei is depicted with a striking blend of vulnerability and desperation. His high cheekbones and deep blue eyes convey the weight of his turmoil, filled with both longing and frustration. His dark hair is tousled, adding to the sense of his disordered mental state. He is dressed in a slightly rumpled, charcoal gray suit that hints at his discomfort, the fabric catching the light to reveal intricate textures. His posture is dynamic; he stands with one hand pressed against his forehead in a gesture of self-reflection, while the other clenches at his side, knuckles white with tension. His stance is slightly hunched, and he seems to teeter on the edge of despair and resolve, embodying the internal battle between love and hatred he feels toward Polina.

Surrounding Alexei, the casino setting pulses with life, fusing the allure and chaos of gambling. The background is filled with patrons adorned in extravagant attire, creating a tapestry of vibrant colors. Women in shimmering gowns of emerald, ruby, and sapphire swirl about, their laughter and chatter fueling the energy of the space. Men in tailored suits and bow ties add to the atmosphere of opulence, their expressions caught between excitement and anxiety.

The roulette table looms nearby, its surface glistening under a canopy of warm light, decorated with a vibrant spectrum of colored chips that sparkle enticingly. The wheel, anxious and spinning, parallels Alexei's own tumultuous thoughts, embodying the risk and unpredictability of his desires. The exaggerated forms of the patrons in the background are painted with swift, bold strokes, creating a sense of motion and urgency, as if the entire scene pulses with Alexei’s racing heartbeat.

Above the floor, opulent chandeliers hang low, casting flickering glimmers that dance across the room, enhancing the dramatic atmosphere. The lavish draperies of deep crimson and gold filter the light, creating shadows that evoke a sense of entrapment as they frame Alexei’s emotional isolation.

As the viewer's eye moves across the scene, subtle details emerge: a nearby fan lying abandoned on the floor, embodying forgotten passions, and a discarded champagne glass tipped over, symbolizing wasted opportunities. The overall color palette is rich and contrasts deep blues and blacks with vibrant reds and gilded golds, emphasizing the emotional stakes at play. The exaggerated forms and vivid hues exemplify the Expressionist style, conveying the depth of Alexei's emotional struggle and the chaotic beauty of the casino around him.

This illustration invites viewers to peer into Alexei's conflicted psyche—a moment steeped in love, loathing, and existential questioning, capturing the essence of Dostoyevsky's exploration of human emotion amidst the seductive yet perilous world of gambling.
