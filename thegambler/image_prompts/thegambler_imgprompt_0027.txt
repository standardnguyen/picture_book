The illustration captures a moment heavy with intrigue and desperation as Alexei Ivanovich confides in Polina Alexandrovna about the implications of a potential marriage to Mlle. Blanche, set against the opulent backdrop of the casino in Roulettenburg. 

In the foreground, Alexei stands with an earnest and slightly anxious expression, his youthful features rendered in a way that highlights his emotional conflict. He has high, expressive cheekbones, deep blue eyes that convey both desperation and fervor, and slightly tousled dark hair that reflects his inner turmoil. Dressed in a dark, slightly rumpled suit of rich charcoal and deep navy, his attire hints at both social standing and the weight of his concerns. One hand is raised, gesturing emphatically as he speaks, while the other rests against his hip, indicating a blend of urgency and reluctance. The angle of his shoulders suggests he is leaning slightly forward, eager for Polina's understanding.

Polina is depicted with striking allure and confidence, standing directly opposite Alexei. Her sharp, sophisticated features are framed by long waves of dark hair that cascade over her shoulders, illuminated by the soft, colorful lights of the casino. She wears a lavish gown of shimmering emerald green satin that accentuates her figure and flows gracefully to the floor, caught in motion as if responding to Alexei's words. The gown's intricately embroidered details catch the light, reflecting her status and hinting at her emotional complexity. Her intense green eyes are wide with curiosity and determination, focused keenly on Alexei, and her posture exudes a mix of defiance and contemplation. One hand is raised, pointed towards the casino as if signaling their next move, while the other rests on her hip, emphasizing her authority in the conversation.

The scene unfolds within the casino’s bustling environment, characterized by vibrant colors and extravagant decor that embodies the chaotic allure of gambling. The background is teeming with patrons, their forms slightly blurred to suggest movement—men in tailored suits and women in glamorous dresses, their laughter and chatter creating an ambiance of excitement and tension. Ornate chandeliers hang above, casting sparkling reflections onto the polished marble floor, while rich crimson and gold draperies frame the room, enveloping the characters in warmth and drama.

Subtle details accentuate the narrative: a stack of brightly colored chips sits on a nearby gaming table, representing both opportunity and risk, while a glass filled with dark liquid, possibly champagne, reflects the casino's opulence. In Polina's vicinity, a small portrait of a woman resembling Mlle. Blanche hangs on the wall—a quiet testament to the competition for affection and status within their circles.

The overall color palette is bold and expressive, employing deep greens, vibrant golds, and rich reds that emphasize the emotional currents at play. The exaggerated forms and vivid colors contribute to an Expressionist style that encapsulates the anxiety, ambition, and tumultuous relationships woven throughout the narrative. This illustration invites viewers into a pivotal moment of decision and tension, embodying the complexities of Dostoyevsky's exploration of love, money, and the human condition.
