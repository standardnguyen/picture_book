The illustration captures a tense moment within an opulent, dimly lit casino, embodying the blend of despair and hope that permeates the narrative. 

In the foreground, a young man stands slightly hunched over a roulette table, his expression a mixture of fervent conviction and underlying anxiety. He has sharp, angular features accentuated by the harsh overhead lighting, which casts dramatic shadows across his pale complexion. His dark hair, tousled and disheveled, suggests a state of agitation, as if he has not been able to contain his restless thoughts. Dressed in a fitted dark suit that is showing signs of wear, his attire captures his desperate circumstances. His hazel eyes gleam with a fervent belief in his impending fortune, yet they are tinged with uncertainty, creating a striking contrast between his hope and the realization of his present losses.

Adjacent to him, Polina stands, a figure of elegance wrapped in an aura of detached disbelief. Her beauty is emphasized by a flowing gown of deep green velvet, clasped at the waist with a delicate silver belt, which compliments her fair skin and gives her an ethereal appearance. Her long hair is styled in loose waves that cascade down her back, with a few rebellious strands framing her face. As she gazes at the young man, her expression is one of surprised concern, with her brows slightly furrowed and her lips parted in a soft 'O' of incredulity. One hand rests lightly on the edge of the roulette table, while the other hand touches her chin, conveying both contemplation and skepticism about his fervent assertions.

In the background, the casino unfolds with an ornate, luxuriously chaotic atmosphere. Flickering chandeliers cast an intricate play of light and shadow across the scene, highlighting the opulence while enhancing the oppressive sense of expectation that fills the air. The red and gold decor of the casino is rich and vibrant, with gilded frames and plush carpets detailing the excesses of wealth that surround the characters. Other players at the table—vaguely outlined in shadow—add to the atmosphere of tension, their faces obscured but their postures tense as they watch the young man, reflecting the collective anticipation and anxiety encompassing them all.

The roulette wheel in the center gleams ominously, the colors of red and black mirroring the inner turmoil of the characters. The juxtaposition of the joyful, carefree atmosphere typically associated with gambling against the young man’s burdened spirit encapsulates the emotional nuances of Dostoyevsky's narrative. 

Through bold colors and exaggerated forms, this scene is painted to emphasize the psychological struggle between hope and despair, underscoring the themes of addiction and the invasive nature of need that both characters grapple with. The environment pulsates with the energy of risk, reflecting the characters' tumultuous relationship with fortune and fate. This explosive emotional landscape serves to envelop the viewer, inviting them to feel the gravity of the moment as it unfolds.
