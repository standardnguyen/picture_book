“The next train leaves at 9:30, Madame,” I interposed, with a view to checking her agitation.

So they had all gathered together—endeavouring to calm and dissuade the Grandmother. Only Polina was absent. For her part the Grandmother had nothing for the party but abuse.

“Diantre!” muttered Mlle. under her breath, but her eyes were flashing.
