The illustration captures a dramatic and chaotic scene at the Casino, infused with tension and emotional strife. In the foreground, **the Grandmother** occupies the center, her robust figure clad in a flamboyant gown of deep crimson that reflects her fierce personality. Her silver hair, hastily styled into a bun, frizzes at the sides, indicated her frenzied state. Her expression is a tempest of anger and desperation, eyes wide and filled with a fiery intensity as she addresses the croupier and the surrounding casino patrons. One hand is raised, gesturing animatedly, while the other clutches a handful of banknotes as if ready to stake her next gamble.

Beside her, **Alexis Ivanovich** stands with a mix of unease and dutiful obedience. He is depicted as a slender young man, his dark hair tousled, wearing a slightly wrinkled dark overcoat that hints at his lowly station. His face registers concern and exasperation, brow furrowed as he holds a betting slip, gesturing helplessly with one hand while the other is drawn protectively closer to the Grandmother.

In the background, **the croupier** emerges as a striking figure, dressed in a classic black waistcoat and white shirt, with the air of calculated indifference that defines his role. His expression, subtly smug, conveys the anticipation of the Grandmother’s inevitable losses—eyes keenly observing the bets while the roulette wheel spins. He leans slightly forward, his hands poised on the table, ready to rake in the chips that represent the Grandmother's failed attempts at fortune.

The surrounding crowd of **casino patrons** is depicted engaged in a mix of amusement and concern, their faces exaggerated with expressions of shock and laughter. A notable presence is **Mlle. Blanche**, draped in an elegant emerald green gown in the background, her expression a blend of disdain for the commotion and sly satisfaction at the Grandmother’s unfolding misfortune. 

The atmosphere is enriched with vivid colors—deep reds of the Grandmother's gown contrast against the cooler tones of Alexis's overcoat, while the warm hues of the casino’s opulent decor and golden light accentuate the air of excess and despair. The roulette wheel sits prominently in the midground, its numbers a blur of color, symbolizing the chaotic unpredictability of fortune.

Above them, an ornate chandelier hangs, casting shimmering reflections across the scene, suggesting the wealth and allure of the casino that entraps its participants. A swirl of movement and energy in the composition enhances the sense of immediacy and drama, emphasizing the internal struggles and desires of the characters—all reflecting the deeper themes of addiction and desperation echoed throughout Dostoyevsky’s narrative.
