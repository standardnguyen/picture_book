The illustration captures the electric atmosphere of the Casino as the Grandmother's excitement reaches a fever pitch amidst the gambling throng. In the foreground, **Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha** is depicted with her striking presence in her finely crafted wheeled chair. She wears a rich black silk gown that flows elegantly, its delicate lace cuffs glimmering subtly under the bright lights of the Casino. Her silver hair, meticulously styled in a tight bun, adds to her air of authority. Her weathered but expressive face displays a mixture of fervor and impatience, as her eyes sparkle with determination while watching the roulette wheel. One hand tightly grips the armrest of her chair, while the other is animatedly pointing towards the roulette table, indicating her desire for action.

Beside her, **Alexei Ivanovich** leans into the scene, depicted as a young man with soft features and carrying an air of apprehension. He wears a dark, tailored suit that contrasts with the opulence of the Casino. His furrowed brow and wide eyes reveal his inner conflict between respecting the Grandmother’s enthusiasm and his caution regarding her reckless gambling. His gestures are tentative as he tries to explain the game's intricacies while balancing her fervent nudges.

In the center of the painting, the roulette table dominates the composition, the wheel subtly rotating, reflecting numerous golden chips scattered about. Around the table, various **gamblers** are engulfed in their own tension; some lean forward with eager anticipation, their faces illuminated with the thrill of the game, while others display fretful expressions of despair at their losses. A **young lady**, elegantly dressed in a flowing gown with delicate embroidery, sits closely beside a **dwarf**, who appears wise and observant. The pair are engaged in their own game, the dwarf intently watching the wheel, while the lady’s hand hovers over her chips, revealing a cold, calculated demeanor.

In the background, a group of **spectators**, including **English families**, are gathered. Some hold lorgnettes, peering at the unfolding drama, their expressions a mix of astonishment and intrigue at the sight of the Grandmother’s fervent participation. A pair of **croupiers** stand at the helm of the roulette table, both wearing formal suits; they project composure amidst the chaos, directing the game with practiced authority, their hands engaged in the process of collecting bets and distributing winnings.

The aura within the Casino pulsates with vibrant colors—rich reds and greens from the plush carpeting and velvet curtains contrasting with the gleaming gold of coins and banknotes that litter the table. Dramatic shadows play across the scene, creating an atmosphere that captures the tension between fortune and misfortune, while the lively energy of the gamblers illuminates the desperation inherent in their pursuits. This Expressionist portrayal emphasizes the illuminating conflict of desire and loss, inviting viewers to explore the themes of obsession and emotional turmoil in Dostoyevsky's narrative.
