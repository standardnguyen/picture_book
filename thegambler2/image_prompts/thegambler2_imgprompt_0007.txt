The illustration depicts a crowded and chaotic gaming hall of the casino in Roulettenburg, alive with vibrant activity that mirrors the intense emotional undercurrents of the gambling scene. In the foreground, **Alexei Ivanovich** takes center stage, standing rigidly at the roulette table. His sharp, angular features are etched with anguish and determination, framed by tousled dark hair that seems to reflect his inner turmoil. He wears a slightly worn dark suit that hints at his precarious social standing. His hands are clenched tightly around a stack of coins, knuckles pale as he prepares to stake Polina’s money, while his eyes are wide and filled with a mix of apprehension and resolve, conveying the weight of expectation and anxiety.

Surrounding Alexei, the crowd's expressions are a blend of eagerness and desperation, showcasing a diverse range of gamblers caught in the fever of chance. Among them, a **Frenchman** in an extravagant, brightly colored suit stands nearby, eyes glinting with greed, his posture relaxed yet predatory as he anticipates his next move. His flamboyant attire starkly contrasts with Alexei's more subdued clothing, highlighting the disparity between their motivations for gambling.

In the background, the towering roulette wheel spins, adorned with vibrant reds and blacks, casting a spell over the gathered players. **Polina Alexandrovna** is portrayed standing slightly to the side, her elegant form accentuated by a flowing gown of deep blues and gold that catches the light beautifully. She watches the proceedings with a captivating smile, elegantly holding a fan near her face, her expression indulgent yet calculating, as if she is completely aware of the hold she has over Alexei's emotions. Her dark hair is styled in soft waves, framing her face in a way that enhances her enigmatic allure.

Looming over the scene are opulent chandeliers, their soft, warm light illuminating the players' faces and accentuating the tension that fills the air. The decor of the gaming hall features rich reds and golds, enhancing the overall atmosphere of opulence and despair that characterizes the casino environment. Amidst this backdrop, the faces of the other gamblers exemplify the emotional rollercoaster of chance—some are laughing in joy at their wins, while others display the agony of loss, their expressions twisted in frustration.

Near the edges of the illustration, faint silhouettes of patrons are seen engaged in heated disputes over winnings—gestures of accusation and defense illustrate the moral chaos of gambling, while the croupiers at the ends of the table maintain an air of composure amidst the turmoil, their expressions focused yet tired. 

Overall, the image embodies the frenetic energy and deep emotional stakes of the roulette table, blending both the superficial glamour and the underlying desperation that defines the world of gambling in Dostoyevsky's "The Gambler." The use of vivid colors and dynamic forms emphasizes the expressionist style, capturing not just the external scene but also the complex inner emotions of the characters intertwined in a game where fortune is as fleeting as the fleeting smiles among the crowd.
