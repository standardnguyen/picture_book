The illustration captures a critical moment of intense anticipation and desperation as **Alexei** stands alone in front of a grand but foreboding casino. The scene is drenched in a dramatic twilight that casts long shadows across the marble floor, enhancing the emotional gravity of his inner turmoil. 

In the foreground, **Alexei** is depicted as a young man in his late twenties, with a haunting intensity in his expression. His dark, unkempt hair is tousled, falling over his furrowed brow, framing his pale, angular face. The sharp lines of his cheekbones and the pronounced hollow of his cheeks convey the toll that gambling and emotional conflict have taken on him. His large, deep-set eyes shine with a mix of fear and determination, reflecting the chaotic thoughts swirling within—caught between hope and despair.

He is dressed in a worn, dark frock coat that drapes loosely around his slender form, further emphasizing his disheveled appearance. The coat's frayed edges and faded fabric speak to his deteriorating situation and financial ruin. In one hand, he clutches a single gülden, the coin glistening faintly in the dim light, symbolizing both a glimmer of hope and the precariousness of his circumstances. His other hand is raised in an expressive gesture, as if he is simultaneously reaching out for either salvation or escape, embodying the emotional struggle encapsulated by his thought: “Tomorrow all shall be ended!”

The background is filled with exaggerated forms of opulent casino architecture—tall, curved columns and elaborate chandeliers hanging overhead, their crystals catching the dwindling light and casting a kaleidoscope of shadows on the polished floor. Yet, instead of an air of celebration and excitement, the environment feels oppressive and suffocating, as if the casino itself is a living entity, closing in around him.

The color palette employs intense, vivid hues—deep reds, greens, and blacks intermingle to create a sense of foreboding, with splashes of gold reflecting the flickering light, imparting an air of both danger and allure. The dramatic contrasts enhance the emotional weight of the scene, emphasizing Alexei’s isolation, as he is surrounded by blurred figures of indistinct patrons in the background, their faces expressionsless and faded, contributing to the sense of his profound loneliness amidst the thrumming chaos of the gambling house.

Overall, this illustration represents the theme of desperation and the decisive moment before a significant act, capturing the emotional crescendo of Alexei's internal conflict with vivid imagery that reflects the turbulent stream of his thoughts and the dark allure of chance that binds him to this moment.
