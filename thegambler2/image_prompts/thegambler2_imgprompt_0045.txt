The illustration depicts a tense and dramatic moment within the Grandmother's hotel room, capturing the turmoil of emotions and the looming tensions among the characters. In the foreground, **the Grandmother** is portrayed as a stout, fiery elderly woman in a brilliant crimson gown, her silver hair elegantly but haphazardly arranged in a bun, with loose strands cascading down her face. Her expression is fierce and animated, eyes wide with indignation as she raises a gnarled hand, almost claw-like, to gesture forcefully at the characters surrounding her. Her brows are knitted tightly together, emphasizing her aggravation and sense of urgency, creating an aura of authority and defiance.

**Alexis Ivanovich** stands directly beside her, a young man in his twenties, slender and visibly anxious, dressed in an understated dark overcoat that appears slightly worn. His dark hair is tousled, reflecting his inner turmoil. His expression is a mix of concern and exasperation, with downturned lips and furrowed brows. He leans slightly forward, his posture attentive as he tries to mediate the situation, hands partially raised in a gesture combining pleading and caution, hoping to defuse the Grandmother's ire.

Gathered around the room are the remaining party members, illustrating a spectrum of reactions to the Grandmother's outburst. **De Griers**, the middle-aged gentleman, stands off to the right, a figure in a tailored, dark frock coat, his face contorted in embarrassment and frustration. His mouth is set in a thin line, his eyebrows pulled tight in a blend of concern for the General and disdain for the Grandmother's tirade, as he gently shrinks away from the confrontation.

To the Grandmother's left, **Mlle. Blanche** is depicted with an air of feigned amusement, her striking emerald gown swirling around her legs. A wry smile plays on her lips as she rolls her eyes, her deep-set eyes flashing with a mix of disdain and mockery directed at the Grandmother’s stubbornness. She stands with one hand on her hip, illustrating her nonchalance toward the chaos unfolding around her.

At the back of the room, **Polina** is portrayed as a young woman with a serious demeanor, dressed in a modest, yet elegant gown, her features reflecting care and concern. Her dark hair is styled neatly, and she stands with her arms crossed defensively, trying to balance her loyalty to her Grandmother against her own burdens and responsibilities. Her expression is earnest, showing a mix of gratitude and reluctance as she listens to the Grandmother’s propositions.

The setting is warm and richly decorated, with plush furnishings that speak to the opulent yet strained lives of the characters. The golden hues of the room contrast with the vivid colors of the characters' garments, creating a dynamic visual of inner and outer conflicts. The atmosphere is thick with tension—characters are depicted with exaggerated forms, their facial expressions imbued with intense emotion, revealing the emotional stakes at play. This Expressionist style captures the essence of Dostoyevsky’s narrative, emphasizing the chaotic interplay of human relationships, desires, and the desperation that fuels their actions.
