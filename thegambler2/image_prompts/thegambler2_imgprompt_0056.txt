The illustration captures a moment charged with tension and unexpected intimacy in a dimly lit room, where shadows mingle with soft, flickering light. 

In the foreground, **Polina** is depicted as a young woman in her late twenties, her delicate features accentuated by the gloom that envelops her. She has long, wavy dark hair that cascades down her shoulders, partially obscuring her face and giving her an air of fragility. Her complexion is pale, with dark circles under her eyes reflecting strain and emotional turmoil, while her expression carries a mix of determination and vulnerability. Polina is dressed in a modest, flowing nightdress that hints at her refined background but emphasizes her disheveled state, contrasting her elegance with a sense of weariness. As she stands at the table, she is leaning slightly forward, the open letter in her hand, her fingers trembling lightly as if the weight of her words bears heavily upon her.

In the background, **Alexei** is portrayed hesitantly entering the room, his face a canvas of shock and yearning. He is a young man in his mid-twenties, his hair slightly tousled, wearing a simple but neatly tailored coat that appears slightly rumpled, reflecting his fraught emotional state. His expression is wide-eyed with surprise, the corners of his mouth betraying a flicker of hope amidst the confusion. He stands near the open door, his posture tense and uncertain, one hand pressed against the doorframe as if to ground himself. The light from the candle illuminates his face, creating stark shadows that enhance the drama of the moment.

The room itself is modest, with a heavy-draped window casting long shadows across the wooden floor. An ornate, but worn, table stands between them, cluttered with remnants of a previous conversationâ€”sheets of crumpled paper, a solitary ink well, and the candle that now flickers dangerously, casting warm light across the scene. The wallpaper is peeling, revealing timeworn patterns of faded elegance that hint at a more prosperous past, enveloping the atmosphere with a sense of nostalgia and melancholic beauty.

The color palette is rich and expressive, dominated by deep blues and warm ochres that reflect the emotional tension between the two characters. The shadows seem to swallow parts of the room, enhancing the feeling of intimacy yet isolation, creating a space that is both a sanctuary and a prison for their conflicting emotions. This Expressionist artwork serves to embody the complexity of human connection, highlighting the interplay of hope, desperation, and the intricate layers of their relationship in a poignant moment of revelation.
