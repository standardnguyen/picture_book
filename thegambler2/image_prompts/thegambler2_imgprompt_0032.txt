The illustration portrays a dramatic moment in **Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha**'s opulent hotel suite, emphasizing her powerful presence and the friction with her family. Rich fabrics, ornate furnishings, and sunlight casting shadows set the stage.

**Antonida**, seated upright in a carved armchair, wears a black silk gown with lace accents. Her silver hair in a bun frames sharp, intense eyes as she scolds **The General**, who stands defensively in a military uniform, brow furrowed and posture tense.

**Alexei Ivanovich** watches from behind, arms crossed, expressing both respect and discomfort. **Potapitch**, the servant, stands ready with notepad in hand, nervous yet attentive. The **landlord**, hunched and avoiding her gaze, embodies submission.

In the background, **Mlle. Blanche** in a vivid riding habit looks stunned, while **Mr. Astley** leans casually, a hint of amusement in his expression. Bold colors and exaggerated postures heighten the tension, illustrating themes of authority and familial conflict in Dostoyevskyâ€™s narrative.
