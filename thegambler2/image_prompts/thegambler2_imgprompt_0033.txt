The illustration vividly captures the bustling scene as the Grandmother embarks on her visit to the Casino, filled with both anticipation and sternness. The background showcases the opulent structure of the Casino, its ornate architecture highlighted by sunlight, while the entrance is framed by elegantly dressed commissionaires and footmen, their faces portraying a mix of respect and curiosity as they observe the unusual party.

In the foreground, **Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha** commands the scene, seated regally in her elaborate wheeled chair, which features intricate carvings and plush upholstery. She wears a fitted black silk gown adorned with delicate lace cuffs, and her silver hair is pulled into a neat bun, emphasizing her sharp facial features and expressive, piercing eyes. Her expression is one of determination mingled with bemusement as she surveys her surroundings, a finger raised to indicate her next direction, embodying both authority and exuberance.

Flanking her on both sides are **Polina** and **Mlle. Blanche**. Polina is dressed in a flowing lavender gown, her reddish-brown hair cascading down her shoulders, framing her gentle yet assertive features. She maintains an attentive posture, her expression a combination of patience and concern as she responds to the Grandmother’s relentless queries. Mlle. Blanche, in a stylish azure riding habit, leans in slightly toward the Grandmother, her demeanor animated and effervescent, showcasing her vibrant smile and engaging charm as she playfully banters with Antonida.

On the opposite side, **Potapitch** and **Martha** trail behind, embodying the role of dutiful servants. Potapitch is depicted in a formal frock coat and white waistcoat, looking slightly nervous yet attentive, his brow furrowed as he listens to the Grandmother's demands. Martha, a rosy-cheeked woman with slight grey strands peeking through her mobcap, wears a simple cotton dress and squeaking shoes. She appears slightly hesitant, glancing nervously towards the Grandmother, her expression caught between servitude and a desire to support her charge.

In the middle distance, **De Griers** walks with an air of pleasant determination, looking charming in his tailored light suit. He glances back at the General, subtly suggesting his hope for an adventurous day ahead. The General’s figure hovers on the periphery, depicted as a tall man in a dark military uniform, his brow furrowed and lip slightly pursed in disapproval, betraying his inner conflict as he trails behind, overwhelmed yet compliant with the Grandmother's ambitions.

The environment around the Casino is bustling, with other patrons and spectators caught in animated conversations and the clamor of excitement, their expressions a mixture of anticipation and intrigue as they observe the Grandmother's unorthodox entrance. The palette is rich with bold colors—deep blacks and greens of the attire contrasting with the warm sunlight hitting the Casino's facade—creating a vibrant and dynamic image that reflects the mixture of social hierarchy, anticipation, and tension that permeates the scene. This Expressionist portrayal accentuates the dramatic inner emotions of each character, visually capturing Dostoyevsky’s exploration of family dynamics and social interactions in the context of gambling culture.
