The illustration captures the intense emotional landscape of a hotel room at dawn, filled with tension and turmoil, following a night of fervent discussions and unspoken desires.

In the foreground, **Polina** is depicted as a striking figure, embodying an array of complex emotions. She stands by the window, partially illuminated by the soft morning light filtering through the open panes. Her dark, flowing hair is tousled, cascading over her shoulders, and framing her pale, troubled face that reflects a mixture of confusion and resolve. Clothed in an elegant yet simple nightdress, her posture is both rigid and yet expansive, as she leans slightly out of the window, elbows resting on the windowsill, lost in thought, yet exuding a fierce energy. The morning mist outside enhances her ethereal appearance, suggested by the delicate shadows that dance across her features.

In the center of the room, a modest wooden table is overloaded with scattered banknotes—some crumpled, others still perfectly aligned—creating a chaotic but compelling centerpiece that symbolizes the conflict over financial power and autonomy. The remnants of the previous night’s revelations are strewn about, embodying the weight of heavy decisions yet to be made. 

**Alexei** is seated at the edge of the bed, partially turned towards Polina, frozen in an expression of shock and desperation. He is depicted as a young man with unkempt dark hair and a face marked by fatigue and anxiety from the night’s tensions. His attire is a disheveled combination of a fashionable yet rumpled coat and a loosened shirt—details that suggest his recent return from the casino’s chaotic environment. His gaze is fixed on Polina, eyes wide open and brimming with a mix of longing and dread, capturing the immediate aftermath of their fraught exchanges.

The background atmosphere of the room is intricately detailed, with rich colors blending in an Expressionist style. The deep hues of navy blue and muted earth tones contrast with the soft light illuminating Polina, heightening the emotional complexity of the scene. Various decorative elements, like a faded tapestry and an ornate mirror, line the walls—echoing a sense of nostalgia while hinting at a past grandeur that now shadows their immediate conflict. 

The room is filled with an air of melancholy and desperation, expressed through the positioning of objects around them: a small, heavy trunk stands closed, suggesting hidden hopes or unresolved matters. Shadows gather beneath the furniture, amplifying the emotional weight of the moment.

Overall, the illustration encapsulates the tumultuous dynamics between Alexei and Polina, reflecting their struggles with love, pride, and the bitter realities of their entangled lives. The vivid imagery invites viewers to delve into the depths of human emotion, while the dramatic contrasts of light and shadow evoke the feelings of hope and despair that characterize Dostoyevsky's poignant narrative.
