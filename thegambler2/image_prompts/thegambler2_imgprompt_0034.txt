The illustration captures the vibrant and chaotic atmosphere of the Casino, focusing on the Grandmother’s enthralled presence as she experiences the roulette game. In the foreground, **Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha** is depicted in her exquisitely carved wheeled chair, a striking figure at the center of the scene. She is dressed in a fitted black silk gown, its delicate lace cuffs catching the light, while her silver hair is styled into a neat bun. Her angular features, crowned by sharp, perceptive eyes, twinkle with curiosity as she observes the gamblers around her. Her expression is a mix of anticipation and authority, enhanced by a slight smile of delight at the unfolding events.

Surrounding her, the **Casino's interior** is alive with color and energy. The roulette wheel in prime view spins gracefully, while the illuminated tables shimmer with golden chips and stacks of banknotes. A group of **English onlookers**, dressed in formal attire, gather closely, their heads adorned with hats, and their faces lit with expressions of intrigue and disbelief. Many are attempting to peep over shoulders, holding lorgnettes to better examine the unusual sight of the elderly matron participating in such a milieu.

Next to the Grandmother stands **Alexei Ivanovich**, depicted as a young man in a simple yet elegant suit. His features convey a blend of apprehension and responsibility as he leans forward, attempting to appease the Grandmother’s simmering excitement. His posture reflects eagerness as he exchanges whispers with her, a delicate balance of guidance and caution.

To the left, a **young gambler** stands at the roulette table, his eyes wide with the thrill of his wins. He is a youthful figure, wearing a light-colored jacket, his hands shaking slightly as he stacks his recently won fortune—an impressive pile of gold coins and bank notes that gleam under the Casino lights. The sparkle in his eyes captures the rush of success, yet reveals an underlying madness to the game, directing attention to his intoxication with the stakes.

Nearby, a **Polish attendant**, dressed in an elegant suit that contrasts slightly with the chaotic scene, stands in near reverence beside the young man, whispering suggestions in a posture of fierce eagerness—his expression animated yet suppliant. The tension is palpable as he leans in, urging encouragement.

The background is filled with **jeering spectators**, depicted with exaggerated forms and expressions—some laughing, others gasping, reflecting the thrill of gambling culture. The **croupiers**, stationed behind the table, maintain their professional demeanor, their sharp suits and rhythmic gestures directing the game and ensuring order amid the frenzied anticipation of the players. 

The color palette bursts with vivid hues—deep reds and greens from the tables, the rich gold of winnings, and the soft glow of the overhead chandeliers, all converging to create a sense of lively chaos that mirrors the characters’ inner turmoil around the roulette wheel. In this Expressionist rendering, the contrast between the Grandmother’s commanding presence and the frenetic energy of the Casino encapsulates the dichotomy of control and losing oneself in the thrill of the game, highlighting Dostoyevsky's keen insight into human desires and the perils of gambling.
