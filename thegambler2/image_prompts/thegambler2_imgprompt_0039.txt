The illustration captures a moment charged with tension and complex emotions, set within the lavish ambiance of the Casino. **Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha**, the Grandmother, is portrayed at the center with an exuberant expression, exuding a sense of victory and childlike joy. She is in her ornate wheeled chair, clad in an opulent black silk gown that falls gracefully around her, embellished with intricate lace cuffs and sparkling pin-like designs. Her silver hair, meticulously styled into a tight bun, frames her angular face, with piercing eyes gleaming with delight. Her hands, adorned with rings, are outstretched joyfully as she eagerly flings gold coins in the direction of those around her, embodying her newfound grandeur.

To her right stands **De Griers**, depicted as a middle-aged man with a well-groomed beard and rich, flowing attire, his expressions a mixture of fascination and anxiety. He leans slightly forward, his hand gesturing animatedly as if trying to charm the Grandmother with compliments, his bright eyes reflecting both admiration and desperation. His demeanor is exaggerated with a sense of urgency, creating a palpable tension between his hopes and the unpredictability of the Grandmother's whims.

To the left is **Mlle. Blanche**, portrayed as a striking young woman with delicate features and an air of sophistication. Her luxurious gown is richly colored—perhaps deep emerald or royal blue—with intricate detailing that accentuates her figure. Blanche's face is composed yet crafted with longing; her eyes narrow slightly as she plays the role of the coy coquette, subtly nuzzling forward in an attempt to capture the Grandmother’s attention while revealing a hint of jealousy and ambition. Her posture is alluring, yet there's an underlying tension in her crossed arms, which suggests her determination to secure her position at any cost.

In the background, **the General** is present, depicted as an older, stately figure dressed in a formal military outfit, his expression a mix of disdain and fear. His brows are tightly knit, and his lips are pressed into a thin line as he watches the scene unfold with a palpable sense of dread. The artist should capture the slight tremor in his clenched fists, subtly conveying his internal strife as he contemplates the implications of the Grandmother's actions on his future.

Surrounding them are a cluster of **onlookers**, their faces animated with curiosity and disbelief. Some are dressed in splendid evening garments, showcasing the societal elite that frequents the Casino. Their eyes, wide with astonishment, vary from admiration to bitterness, reflecting their complex feelings about the surreal spectacle unfolding before them. The colors used for the background should reflect a lavish atmosphere: rich golds and greens of the Casino decor contrasted against the deeper tones of night pouring in from large windows.

The overall composition conveys a sense of swirling energy. The exaggerated expressions and gestures of each character, along with the dynamic interplay of light and shadow, create an atmosphere of heightened emotional stakes and underlying tension. This illustration encapsulates the essence of the narrative, reflecting the themes of ambition, illusion, and the delicate balance of power amidst the heady allure of fortune, all integral to Dostoyevsky's exploration of human nature.
