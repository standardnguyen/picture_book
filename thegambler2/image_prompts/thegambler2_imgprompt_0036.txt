The illustration vividly captures the charged atmosphere of the Casino during a high-stakes moment as the Grandmother revels in her gambling triumph. In the foreground, **Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha** is at the center of the scene, seated proudly in her elaborately carved wheeled chair. She is dressed in a luxurious black silk gown, with intricate lace detailing around the cuffs and collar that glints subtly under the vibrant lights of the Casino. Her silver hair, meticulously styled in a tight bun, frames her sharp, confident features. Antonida's expression is one of triumphant exhilaration, her piercing eyes wide with excitement as she eagerly anticipates the outcome of the spin. One hand is raised slightly, as if urging the wheel to turn in her favor, while her other hand clutches a stack of currency, reflecting her assertive command over the situation.

Next to her, **Alexei Ivanovich** stands, depicted as a young man of slight build, dressed in a classic dark suit that looks somewhat disheveled from his tension. His hands are slightly trembling, revealing the mix of anxiety and thrill that dances within him, mirroring the energy of the room. His brows are furrowed in concern, yet there’s an unmistakable glimmer of excitement in his wide eyes as he prepares to follow the Grandmother's urgent commands. His posture is slightly hunched, signaling both caution and fascination as he engages in the whirlwind of the moment.

The **roulette table**, dominating the foreground, is a marvel of color and activity, adorned with sparkling chips and numerous banknotes. The croupier, in a formal suit, stands poised by the table—a man of practiced professionalism—with a slightly bemused expression as he declares the outcome of the last round. The wheel glistens under the lights, still caught in the motion of its last spin, while an excited group of **gamblers** surrounds the table, their faces animated with a mix of hope and despair, reflecting the emotional turbulence of the game.

The background is filled with a vibrant crowd of **spectators**—English families and other well-dressed patrons—each one leaning in with eager anticipation, their expressions a blend of astonishment and anxiety as they observe the old lady’s dramatic play. Among them are elderly gentlemen wearing top hats, ladies adorned in elegant dresses, and young men with quizzical brows, all watching intently, their eyes wide with the thrill of high-stakes gambling.

Beneath the chandelier’s warm, golden glow, the palette offers a rich tapestry of colors: the deep reds and greens of the Casino decor contrast with the shimmery gold of winnings piling on the table. The energy is palpable; laughter and chatter intertwine with the tense stillness of the spins, creating a cacophony of feelings—anticipation, excitement, and nervousness. This Expressionist portrayal emphasizes the collision of fortune and folly, expertly reflecting Dostoyevsky's exploration of the human condition amidst the intoxicating lure of gambling, with each character's emotional state captured in the dynamic composition.
