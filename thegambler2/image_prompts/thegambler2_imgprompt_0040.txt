The illustration captures a poignant moment of introspection and emotional turmoil as the protagonist ascends the grand staircase of the hotel, reflecting on his complicated feelings for Polina and the unfolding drama surrounding him. The scene is set in a dimly lit corridor, illuminated by the soft glow of antique sconces that cast flickering shadows along the wallpaper, which is adorned with opulent floral patterns that suggest both luxury and decay.

In the foreground, the protagonist is depicted as a young man in his mid-twenties, with unkempt dark hair that falls into his eyes, accentuating his furrowed brow and pensive expression. He wears a slightly wrinkled, dark overcoat, implying both his modest means and the emotional weight he carries. His posture is slouched as he trudges up the stairs, one hand clutching the banister for support while the other hangs limply by his side, conveying his sense of defeat and confusion. His face reflects a mixture of anguish and longing, evident in the way his lips are slightly parted, as if yearning for words that remain unspoken.

As he ascends the staircase, a large window is visible in the background, showcasing the muted twilight sky, hinting at the approaching night and paralleling the darkness enveloping his thoughts. The window frames a view of the bustling casino below, now reduced to a shadowy silhouette, where the echoes of laughter and excitement seem to fade into the oppressive atmosphere that surrounds him.

To enhance the emotional depth of the scene, faint images of Polina emerge in the background, depicted as ethereal ghost-like apparitions. She appears as a graceful figure with flowing hair, clothed in a delicate, light-colored dress that seems to shimmer faintly against the dark backdrop. Her expression is elusive, a mixture of joy and sorrow, capturing the complexity of her relationship with the protagonist. She emits an aura of mystery that entices yet distances him, symbolizing the secrets she keeps and the emotional barrier between them.

The color palette of the illustration emphasizes deep blues and purples of twilight, contrasted with the warm, golden light from the sconces, creating a dramatic interplay of light and shadow that expresses the protagonist's internal conflict. The exaggerated proportions of the staircase and corridor lend a sense of claustrophobia to the scene, enveloping the figure in a space that feels both intimate and isolating, mirroring his emotional state.

Overall, this illustration encapsulates the themes of yearning, confusion, and the search for clarity amidst the chaos of emotions, inviting viewers to interpret the depth of human relationships and the price of vulnerability as portrayed in Dostoyevsky's narrative.
