The illustration depicts a vibrant and chaotic scene within the opulent confines of the Casino, embodying the emotional upheaval and tension described in the text. The atmosphere is thick with social juxtaposition, showcased through a lush palette of deep reds, golds, and greens that reflect the grandeur of the casino setting while highlighting the individual dramas playing out within.

In the foreground, **Mlle. Zelma** is the focal point, crying out with exaggerated animation and flair. She is portrayed with striking features—long, dark hair cascading wildly around her shoulders, with an expressive face that captures both her manic laughter and underlying despair. Her eyes emit a captivating blend of mischief and recklessness, enhanced by dark eyeliner that accentuates the intensity of her expression. She is dressed in a lavish, form-fitting gown of rich emerald silk, adorned with shimmering gold sequins that catch the light, emphasizing her flamboyant personality. As she claws at the fabric of her gown with elegantly manicured, scented nails, a hint of her previous distress is captured in her slightly disheveled appearance, symbolizing her tumultuous state of mind.

To her side stands the **Polish Count**, depicted as a figure of intrigue and curiosity. He has a strong, angular face and wears a stylishly cut, dark suit, reflecting the timeless elegance associated with his aristocratic background. His expression combines surprise and fascination, eyebrows raised and mouth slightly agape as he observes Zelma's dramatics. His slicked-back hair and refined demeanor contrast sharply with Zelma's wild exuberance, highlighting his bewilderment at the spectacle.

In the background, the casino's atmosphere is alive with other patrons, creating an impression of bustling activity and chaos. Women at the roulette tables are portrayed with a mix of indifference and annoyance, their elegant dresses flowing in rich colors—reds and blacks, accented with feathers and jewels. Some players look on disapprovingly at Zelma’s antics, embodying the ‘decent public’ that feels invaded by her presence, while others are enraptured by the unfolding drama.

The **Baron Burmergelm** stands in the middle ground, depicted with a stern, disapproving expression, arms crossed and a sharp gaze directed at Zelma. His clothing—a finely tailored light-colored suit—underscores his social status but contrasts with his rigid stance, casting him as an antagonistic figure amid the revelry. 

The background showcases the grandeur of the casino with elaborate chandeliers casting shimmering light across the scene, while ornate mirrors reflect fragments of chaos, echoing the disarray in Zelma’s life. Shadows loom in the corners, hinting at the darker side of fortune and folly.

Overall, the illustration embodies the Expressionist style through its use of exaggerated forms and vivid colors, capturing the emotional tumult and societal dynamics of the characters. The dramatic interactions and layered expressions speak to the intricate relationship between personal desperation and the intoxicating allure of the casino, reflecting Dostoyevsky’s exploration of fate, chance, and the fragility of fortune.
