The illustration depicts a poignant moment of parting between **Alexei** and **Mr. Astley** in a dimly lit café, encapsulating the complex emotions and themes of hope and despair that course through Dostoyevsky's narrative. 

In the foreground, **Alexei** is seated at a small, round table, his posture reflecting a mixture of desperation and resolve. He is a young man with disheveled, dark hair that falls haphazardly onto his forehead. His face, drawn and angular, shows deep lines of worry etched into his sunken cheeks and expressive, deep-set eyes, which shimmer with a blend of uncertainty and longing. He is clad in a dark, threadbare frock coat that hangs loosely from his form, emphasizing his fragile situation. His hands rest on the table, one gripping the ten louis d’or with tension, while the other gestures in an animated fashion, speaking to his internal struggle and yearning for redemption. The flickering candlelight catches his somber expression, highlighting the turmoil that resides within him.

Opposite him, **Mr. Astley** stands with an air of authority, yet his stance also conveys concern and a hint of disappointment. He is depicted as a tall and commanding figure, dressed impeccably in a well-fitted dark suit that signifies his social status. His hair is neatly combed back, and his eyes flash with a mix of frustration and compassion as he gazes at Alexei. Astley's jaw is set firmly, indicating his resolve, yet there is a softness in his expression that suggests a lingering affection for his friend. He leans slightly forward, emphasizing the urgency of their encounter, with one hand outstretched toward Alexei as if both to offer the money and to bridge the gap of understanding that has formed between them.

The café’s background is richly textured with deep hues of burgundy and shadowy browns, creating an intimate yet oppressive atmosphere that mirrors Alexei’s emotional turmoil. The walls are adorned with lavish dark wood paneling, and plush, velvet drapes frame the windows, enhancing the sense of confinement within the space. The small tables around them are populated by indistinct figures blurred in shadow, signifying the isolation both men feel despite being surrounded by others. 

The lighting is dominated by the warm glow of flickering candlelight, casting dramatic shadows that heighten the emotional intensity of the scene. The contrasts in color, with deep, rich tones against the warm yellows of the candles, symbolize the juxtaposition of hope and despair inherent in their conversation. The exaggerated forms of the characters—especially the intensity in their facial expressions and the tense grip of Alexei's hands—underscore the layers of their relationship, enriched by vulnerabilities and unspoken words.

Overall, this illustration serves as a compelling visual representation of the poignant hope for redemption woven throughout "The Gambler," capturing the essence of Alexei's internal conflict as he contemplates his future amidst the chaos of gambling and lost opportunities, set against the nurturing backdrop of friendship, even in sorrowful farewells.
