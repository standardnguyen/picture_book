The illustration captures a dramatic culmination of excitement and trepidation in a lavishly adorned hotel room, dimly lit by the soft glow of a flickering candle on a modest wooden table. 

In the foreground, **Alexei** is depicted as a young man in his mid-twenties, with tousled dark hair that reflects the chaotic energy of the casino. His expression is a vibrant mix of exhilaration and nervousness, with wide, almost wild eyes that sparkle from the adrenaline of his recent wins. He stands with his arms slightly raised, showing a sheaf of banknotes spilling from his hands, half-stuffing them into his coat pockets. His clothing—a fashionable but slightly rumpled coat—betrays his hasty entrance, with its tousled collar and unbuttoned shirt suggesting a man who has rushed in from the night’s excitement, barely containing his triumph.

In the center of the composition, the table is laden with a staggering pile of money—gold coins gleaming in the candlelight, intermingled with bright, crumpled banknotes fanned out almost haphazardly, establishing a visual feast representing Alexei's recent fortune. This mound draws the viewer’s eye, symbolizing the climax of his gambling fervor.

Opposite him, **Polina** is captured seated on a simple yet elegant sofa, her posture rigid and her expression one of astonishment and discomfort. She is portrayed as a beautiful young woman with long, wavy dark hair casually cascading over her shoulders, framing her pale face, accentuated by an expression that oscillates between skepticism and disdain. Clad in a modest yet refined nightdress, she sits with her hands clasped in her lap, eyes narrowed slightly, reflecting an inner struggle with the emotional weight of the moment. Although she gazes at Alexei, her demeanor suggests a deep contempt veiled beneath the surface as she absorbs the implications of the wealth he has just tossed at her.

The room itself, while elegantly appointed, is filled with a sense of tension. The wallpaper bears age spots and subtle fraying, hinting at a past grandeur that now meets the chaos of the present. Shadows and highlights are blended in a way that emphasizes the emotional turmoil of the characters: the warm light of the candle flickers across their faces, casting distorted shadows that evoke feelings of paranoia and fear of loss.

The atmosphere is charged with palpable emotions. In the background, a heavy drapery partially obscures the window, which allows only thin slants of moonlight to filter through, further enhancing the dramatic and secluded atmosphere. The interior has rich finishes and decorative details, including a few scattered personal items, suggesting a life of elegance tinged with decay.

The color palette embraces deep reds and muted golds, illuminating the intensity of the scene. This Expressionist interpretation captures the duality of victory and despair, illustrating the surreal heights that gambling can reach—the intoxicating allure of success juxtaposed against the looming specter of potential isolation and the chaos of human relationships. The artwork invites viewers to contemplate the fragile boundary between joy and desperation in the lives of Alexei and Polina as they navigate their tumultuous connection amidst the perils of fortune and loss.
