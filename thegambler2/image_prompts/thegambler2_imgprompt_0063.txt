The illustration captures the opulent yet claustrophobic atmosphere of a lavishly decorated hotel room filled with indications of wealth and superficiality, a perfect canvas for illustrating Alexei's internal turmoil and Blanche's extravagant lifestyle.

In the foreground, **Mlle. Blanche** is portrayed reclining languidly on an ornate four-poster bed adorned with lush fabrics. Her swarthy skin is contrasted by a delicate white cambric nightgown trimmed with lace, showcasing her elegant yet seductive figure. Her long, dark hair cascades down the bed, framing her animated face, which is lit with a mischievous smirk as she engages playfully with the viewer. One arm is draped over her head, the other casually gesturing in the air, as if caught mid-conversation, suggesting an exuberant personality that masks her true intentions.

**Alexei** stands nearby, his posture tense and withdrawn. He is depicted as a young man, his dark hair tousled and his face showing signs of fatigue and disillusionment. Clad in an expensive yet ill-fitting coat that suggests both his wealth and discomfort, he gazes upwards, his expression a mixture of longing and resignation. In one hand, he clutches a crumpled banknote, the remnants of his recent windfall, which symbolizes his financial instability and emotional turmoil.

The background features extravagant details, such as an ornate chandelier illuminating the room with a warm, golden light that contrasts with the darker shades of the furniture. A large, lavish trunk sits open, overflowing with luxurious garments and frivolous purchases, signifying Blanche's careless spending. The lavish decor is juxtaposed with the frayed edges of reality; remnants of half-drunk champagne glasses clutter the side tables, along with crumpled notes, lending a sense of chaotic indulgence to the scene.

Ambient details enhance the atmosphere: luxurious curtains drawn back to reveal a hint of the starlit night outside, contrasting with the suffocating interior. Shadows cast across the room evoke a sense of foreboding, hinting at the financial and emotional decimation that lies ahead. The color palette utilizes rich reds, deep blues, and golds, emphasizing the excess and ultimately hollow nature of their extravagant lifestyle.

Overall, the illustration encapsulates the vibrant yet toxic dynamics between Alexei and Blanche, conveying the tension of love and desire amidst betrayal and materialism. It invites viewers to ponder the fragility of fortune and the hollowness that can accompany opulence, reflecting Dostoyevsky's exploration of addiction, money, and the human condition within "The Gambler."
