The illustration presents a tumultuous, emotionally charged moment between **Alexei Ivanovich** and **Polina Alexandrovna** in a secluded, atmospheric stretch of a lush park in Roulettenburg, with the setting sun casting dramatic shadows that accentuate the scene's intensity. 

At the forefront, **Alexei** is depicted with sharp, angular features that reflect his inner turmoil and passionate emotions. His dark hair is tousled, and his eyes are wide, emphasizing desperation and fervor. He stands slightly hunched, his hands gesturing animatedly as if trying to grasp at something intangible. Dressed in a disheveled, slightly worn black suit, the fabric clings to his lean frame, suggesting his obsessive preoccupation with Polina and his current state of mind. His expression is a blend of longing and frustration, with a slight grimace on his lips, as if he is wrestling with an intense internal conflict.

Across from him, **Polina** is captured in a moment of vibrant anger, her face flushed, reflecting her emotional state. She is wearing a flowing gown of deep crimson with intricate lace details, which contrast with her angular features that are softened by the flow of her hair, cascading in soft waves around her shoulders. Her expression is one of indignation and contempt, with narrowed eyes and pursed lips suggesting disbelief at Alexei's declarations. One hand is raised defensively, as though to ward off Alexei’s tumultuous emotions, yet there is a spark of intrigue in her gaze that hints at her conflicting feelings towards him. 

The background is an impressionistic blend of greens and dark browns, suggesting the lush foliage of the park. Dappled light filters through the trees, creating an ethereal atmosphere where the sun's rays hit the scene unevenly, fluctuating between darkness and light. The twisted branches and rustling leaves mirror the chaotic emotional states of the characters. 

Further off in the background, shadowy figures of other park-goers are depicted, their faces obscured to emphasize the personal nature of Alexei and Polina's confrontation. The tension in the air is palpable, and the vivid colors of the setting—a palette of dark greens, rich reds, and golden highlights—underscore the emotional volatility of their interaction. 

Overall, this illustration encapsulates the themes of obsessive love, desperation, and psychological conflict, infused with Expressionist energy. The exaggerated features and vivid colors serve to amplify the mood, inviting viewers to delve deeper into the intricate dance of feelings that defines their relationship.
