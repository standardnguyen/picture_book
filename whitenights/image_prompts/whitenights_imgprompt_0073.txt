The Dreamer stands with a gentle, caring aura, his bittersweet smile directed at Nastenka, who exhibits a blend of relief and sorrow. Nastenka, clasping her hands near her heart, portrays a mix of understanding and compassion, with a slight turn away from the Dreamer. In the background, blurred figures further isolate the pair, intensifying the emotional depth of the scene. Soft hues of blues and grays dominate the color palette, while warm glows from street lamps cast elongated shadows, capturing the delicate interplay between longing and nostalgia during the captivating white nights of St. Petersburg.
