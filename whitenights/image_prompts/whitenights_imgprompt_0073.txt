A serene and contemplative scene in a lush park during the golden hour. Nastenka walks along a winding path lined with blooming flowers, her posture relaxed as she gazes wistfully at a secluded bench under a weeping willow tree. The Dreamer sits on the bench, facing the setting sun, a small smile playing on his lips as he reminisces. The park is drenched in warm hues of sunset, casting long, romantic shadows and infusing the air with a nostalgic tranquility. The setting exudes a sense of gentle longing and quiet remembrance.
