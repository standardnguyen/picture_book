A serene illustration unfolds on the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the captivating white nights. The scene is set on a wide embankment beside a tranquil river, bathed in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes full of a mixture of relief and sorrow, stands with her hands gently clasped near her heart, her body slightly turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring presence with a bittersweet smile, stands beside Nastenka, mirroring her emotional state. Faint, blurred figures in the background enhance the seclusion surrounding the pair. The illustration is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from distant street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a blend of hope and melancholy as they share a poignant moment under the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg.
