A whimsical moment captured on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the enchanting white nights. The scene unfolds on a wide embankment by a tranquil river, bathed in a dreamy twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with eyes reflecting a mix of innocence and hidden sorrows, stands with hands clasped near her heart, exuding a blend of curiosity and warmth. The Dreamer, a gentle young man with a caring countenance and a subtle, wistful smile, gazes at Nastenka with understanding. The background features hazy silhouettes, emphasizing their isolated encounter. The illustration is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with gentle street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, embodying a sense of whimsy and contemplation.
