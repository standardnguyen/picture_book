A poignant illustration capturing Nastenka's fragile state in her small room. Nastenka, depicted as a pale, gaunt young woman with tired eyes, sits on a simple wooden chair, wearing a worn shawl around her shoulders. Her hands clutch a crumpled handkerchief, her expression reflecting a mix of weariness and vulnerability. The room is sparsely furnished, with a single dimly lit lamp casting a somber glow. Shadows play on the walls, emphasizing the sense of isolation and desolation surrounding Nastenka. The atmosphere conveys a profound feeling of loneliness and physical decline.
