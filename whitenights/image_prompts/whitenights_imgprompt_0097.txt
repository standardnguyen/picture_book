Nastenka, a young woman with a delicate frame and tired eyes, stands by the serene river under the soft glow of the white nights in St. Petersburg. Her posture is slouched, and her expression carries a hint of weariness and vulnerability. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a sense of concern and empathy, stands beside her with a comforting gaze, his features reflecting a mix of sympathy and understanding. The background is filled with the hazy silhouettes of passing figures, emphasizing the quiet solitude of the duo in their shared moment. The color palette of the scene is muted, with Nastenka's pale complexion contrasting against the dimly lit surroundings, capturing the somber atmosphere of her emotional and physical struggles.
