A poignant scene set on a quiet embankment beside a river in the mystical ambiance of the white nights in St. Petersburg. The illustration depicts a young woman in a charming yellow hat and a jaunty black mantle, portraying an aura of melancholy and mystery. Her eyes reflect a mixture of sorrow and introspection, her cheeks stained by tear tracks. The woman stands near the riverside, oblivious to the Dreamer's presence, lost in her own world of emotions. The Dreamer, a figure with bated breath and a throbbing heart, observes her with a sense of compassion and hesitancy, eager to offer comfort but held back by uncertainty. The background is enveloped in a soft twilight glow, with street lamps casting gentle shadows around the embankment, emphasizing the solitude of the moment. The atmosphere conveys a delicate balance between empathy and restraint, capturing the fleeting interaction between two solitary souls in the enchanting setting of St. Petersburg.
