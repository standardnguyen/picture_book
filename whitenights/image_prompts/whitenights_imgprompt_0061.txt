A captivating scene unfolds on the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The illustration features a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow beside a tranquil river. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes displaying a mix of relief and sorrow, stands with her hands clasped near her heart, slightly turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring demeanor, wears a bittersweet smile as he gazes towards Nastenka. In the background, blurred figures enhance the sense of isolation surrounding the duo, emphasizing their emotional connection in contrast to the bustling yet distant world. The artwork is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the magical white nights of St. Petersburg.
