An intricate illustration captures a poignant moment during the white nights in St. Petersburg. The scene unfolds on a tranquil embankment beside the river, illuminated by a surreal twilight glow. A young woman, her expressive eyes reflecting a blend of relief and sorrow, stands with hands delicately clasped near her heart. She is slightly turned away from a young man, who exudes a gentle, caring aura and sports a bittersweet smile. The background showcases blurred figures, emphasizing the isolated connection of the pair. Soft hues of blues and grays dominate the artwork, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a mixture of hope and melancholy.
