A melancholic scene set in an empty, moonlit street in St. Petersburg during the white nights. The Dreamer, a young man with a pensive expression, stands under a dim street lamp, his figure casting a long shadow on the cobbled pavement. His hands are tucked in his pockets, shoulders slightly slouched, symbolizing his loneliness. The background shows silhouettes of distant figures departing, emphasizing his sense of isolation in the deserted city. The atmosphere is somber, with a hint of unfulfilled longing in the air.
