A poignant scene on the ethereal streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting is a wide embankment beside a river, bathed in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes, shows a mix of relief and sorrow, clasping her hands near her heart, slightly turned away from the Dreamer, a young man with a gentle, caring demeanor and a bittersweet smile. The background features blurred figures, enhancing the isolation of the pair. The scene is depicted in soft blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting long shadows, symbolizing hope and melancholy.
