A poignant scene set on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting is a wide embankment beside a river, bathed in a surreal twilight glow. The Dreamer, a young man with a contemplative expression and a hint of joy, stands facing Nastenka, a young woman exuding a mix of relief and uncertainty, her hands clasped near her heart. Nastenka, slightly turned away, gazes at the Dreamer with a blend of understanding and hesitation. The background features faint, blurred silhouettes, emphasizing the intimacy of the moment. The color palette consists of soft blues and grays, with warm street lamp glows casting delicate shadows, symbolizing hope and introspection.
