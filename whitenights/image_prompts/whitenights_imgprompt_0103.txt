A poignant illustration set on a quiet embankment in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks, stands with a mixture of anguish and longing, her hands covering her face as she sobs. She is turned away, her body language reflecting deep sorrow. The Dreamer, a young man with a gentle expression and hands reaching out in a comforting gesture, stands close beside her, his eyes filled with empathy and concern. The background is serene, with a surreal twilight glow enveloping the scene, adding a touch of melancholy and hope.
