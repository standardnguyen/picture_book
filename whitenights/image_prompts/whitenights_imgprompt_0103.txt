Amidst the surreal beauty of the St. Petersburg white nights, a scene unfolds at a deserted river embankment. Nastenka, a young woman with teary eyes and a trembling voice, stands with her back slightly turned towards the Dreamer, a young man exuding a mix of empathy and helplessness. Nastenka's hands cover her face as she succumbs to heart-wrenching sobs, her whole figure embodying despair and longing. The Dreamer, with a gentle expression and outstretched hands, tries to console Nastenka, his voice tender and reassuring. The background is shrouded in misty twilight hues, with the river reflecting the soft glow of moonlight, adding a touch of ethereal melancholy to the poignant moment. Blurred silhouettes of passersby in the distance hint at the isolation of the two figures in their emotional turmoil.
