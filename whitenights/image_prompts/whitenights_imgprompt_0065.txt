The scene unfolds in a grand palazzo under alien skies, filled with dazzling lights and the enchanting sounds of music. In the foreground, a young woman, Nastenka, stands on a balcony wreathed in myrtle and roses, her face filled with relief, removing her mask as she whispers, "I am free." Beside her, the Dreamer, with a look of astonishment and joy, reaches out to her. Their eyes meet, and in a rush of emotions, they embrace tightly, forgetting all sorrows and past pains. The background features a sea of lights and a hint of distant lands, evoking a sense of escape and liberation.
