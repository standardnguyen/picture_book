A surreal scene unfolds on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The illustration captures a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow next to a tranquil river. A young woman, Nastenka, is depicted with eyes full of emotion, showing a mix of relief and sorrow as she stands with her hands clasped near her heart, looking slightly away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man with a gentle and caring aura, wears a bittersweet smile as he gazes at Nastenka. In the background, blurred figures add to the sense of isolation surrounding the duo. The artwork showcases a color palette of soft blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the captivating white nights of St. Petersburg.
