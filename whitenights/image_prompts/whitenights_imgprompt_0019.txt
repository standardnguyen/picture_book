The young woman, Nastenka, with a face full of fear and urgency, hastens away from a staggering gentleman in evening attire, who is clumsily pursuing her.

The background is filled with shadows and subtle details, like blurred figures and distant streetlights, adding a sense of urgency and tension to the unfolding chase. The color scheme includes deep blues and hints of shadows to heighten the atmosphere of mystery and danger.
