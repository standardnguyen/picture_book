A poignant illustration set on a quiet bridge over a gently flowing river in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with delicate features, wipes a tear from her cheek with a soft expression of vulnerability and relief. The Dreamer, a young man with a comforting presence, stands beside her, his gaze filled with empathy and understanding. Their body language conveys a sense of newfound connection and shared sorrow, symbolized by the subtle intertwining of their hands. The background is adorned with soft, ethereal light, casting a melancholic yet hopeful ambiance over the scene.
