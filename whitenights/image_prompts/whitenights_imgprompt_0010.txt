A whimsical illustration capturing a moment in the ethereal streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene takes place on a wide embankment near a river, illuminated by a surreal twilight glow. A young woman, Nastenka, stands with a mix of relief and sorrow, subtly turned away from the Dreamer, a caring young man exuding gentleness. Nastenka's expressive eyes convey complex emotions as she clasps her hands near her heart. In the background, blurred figures emphasize the isolation of the pair. Soft blues and grays dominate the color palette, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, symbolizing hope and melancholy.
