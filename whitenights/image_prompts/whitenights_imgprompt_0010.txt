A serene scene set on a wide embankment beside the river in St. Petersburg during the white nights. The atmosphere is bathed in a surreal twilight glow, casting shadows that dance along the cobblestone street. Nastenka, a young woman with long, flowing hair and a wistful expression in her eyes, stands slightly turned away from the Dreamer. She clasps her hands near her heart, displaying a mix of relief and sorrow as she gazes out into the distance. The Dreamer, a compassionate young man with a gentle smile and a look of understanding, stands beside Nastenka. His eyes reflect a blend of care and longing as he looks upon her. The background features blurred silhouettes of passersby, emphasizing the isolation and intimacy of the two central figures. Soft hues of blues and grays dominate the color palette, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows along the path. This illustration captures a moment of quiet connection and shared emotions between Nastenka and the Dreamer amidst the ethereal beauty of the white nights in St. Petersburg.
