An intimate evening scene by the Neva River in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with an expression of vulnerability and anticipation, stands beside the Dreamer, a young man exuding a sense of quiet understanding and empathy. Nastenka's voice reflects a hint of hesitation and longing as she confirms the time. The setting is serene, with soft reflections of moonlight on the water and a distant clock striking eleven, adding a touch of melancholic significance to the moment.
