A serene illustration capturing a moment on the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene unfolds by a tranquil riverbank under a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a delicate woman exuding relief and sorrow, stands with hands clasped near her heart, slightly turning away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man with a caring demeanor and bittersweet smile, gazes at Nastenka. The background showcases blurred silhouettes, enhancing the solitude of the pair. Soft blues and grays dominate the color palette, with warm glows from distant street lamps casting long shadows, evoking feelings of hope and melancholy.
