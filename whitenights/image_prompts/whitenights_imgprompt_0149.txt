In the shimmering setting of St. Petersburg's white nights, a wide embankment by the river is depicted in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with eyes reflecting a mix of emotions, stands with hands clutched near her heart, facing the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a gentle young man with a caring expression and a touch of melancholy, gazes at Nastenka with a sense of urgency. The background shows blurred silhouettes, enhancing the intimate isolation of the pair. Soft blues and grays dominate the scene, lit by warm street lamp glows casting long shadows, encapsulating a moment of decision and anticipation.
