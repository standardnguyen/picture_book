In a dimly lit room, Nastenka, with disheveled hair and teary eyes, stands trembling, clutching a carefully prepared parcel of her belongings. The room is sparsely furnished with a simple bed and a small table. The Dreamer, a young man with a shocked expression, rushes to offer assistance, his hand reaching out in concern. Nastenka's face is hidden in her hands as she sits on the bed, overwhelmed with emotion. Rays of soft light filter through the window, illuminating the scene, emphasizing the raw vulnerability and emotional intensity of the moment.
