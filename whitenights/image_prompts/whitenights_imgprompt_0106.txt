In a quiet garden under the soft illumination of the white nights in St. Petersburg, Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks and quivering lips, stands with her back slightly turned, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. The Dreamer, a compassionate young man with a concerned expression and outstretched hands, gazes at Nastenka with a mix of empathy and encouragement. The atmosphere is serene yet charged with emotion, captured in the dimly lit surroundings and the somber hues of the night.
