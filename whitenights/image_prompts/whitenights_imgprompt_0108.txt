The illustration depicts an intimate moment in a moonlit street of St. Petersburg during the enchanting white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes filled with longing and apprehension, stands holding a piece of paper in one hand, her brow furrowed in concentration. She is clad in a simple yet elegant dress, her posture conveying a mix of emotional vulnerability and determination. The Dreamer, a compassionate young man with a soft smile, leans in slightly towards Nastenka, offering words of guidance. He is depicted gesturing with his hands as if discussing the contents of a letter, his eyes reflecting understanding and encouragement. The background features faint silhouettes of passersby, emphasizing the quietude of the night and the intense focus between Nastenka and the Dreamer. The scene is bathed in soft shades of blue and gray, with gentle light spilling from the street lamps, casting elongated shadows on the cobblestone street.
