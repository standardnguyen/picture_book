On a tranquil evening in St. Petersburg during the enchanting white nights, a scene unfolds by the riverside embankment. Nastenka, with expressive eyes and a mix of emotions, stands with hands clasped, slightly turning away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, exuding a gentle demeanor and a bittersweet smile, gazes at Nastenka with care. The background features blurred figures enhancing their isolation. The setting is bathed in soft blues and grays, with warm streetlamp glows casting melancholic shadows, symbolizing hope and introspection.
