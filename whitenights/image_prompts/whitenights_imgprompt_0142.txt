A moment of concealed emotions unfolds on the serene streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with a pained but composed expression, subtly shields her inner turmoil, her hands clasped tightly as she gazes at the Dreamer with hidden distress. The Dreamer, depicted with a compassionate and concerned demeanor, stands beside her, his eyes reflecting understanding and a hint of sorrow. The background features dimly lit street lamps casting soft glows, enhancing the solemn and introspective atmosphere of the scene.
