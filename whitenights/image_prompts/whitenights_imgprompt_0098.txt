A poignant moment captured in a dimly lit staircase of an old building in St. Petersburg. Nastenka, a young woman with flushed cheeks and teary eyes, stands frozen midway on the stairs, her hand gripping the railing tightly. The Dreamer, a young man with a somber expression and a trace of resolve, descends the stairs with a heavy heart, his eyes cast downwards. The air is filled with unspoken emotions, as the weight of impending departure hangs in the atmosphere. Soft shadows play on the walls, emphasizing the sense of finality and heartache in the scene.
