An intimate scene in Nastenka's cozy home, illuminated by the gentle glow of a candle. Nastenka, a young woman with a warm smile and lively eyes, sits at a wooden table covered in Walter Scott's novels. Her grandmother, a figure of wisdom and guidance, looks over with a kind expression as Nastenka describes her fondness for the books. The room is adorned with lace curtains and a small vase of flowers, creating a homely atmosphere. The lodger, a gentle and curious man, stands nearby, engaging in a friendly conversation with Nastenka about their shared love for literature. The room exudes a sense of comfort and intellectual connection, with the books representing a bridge between these characters.
