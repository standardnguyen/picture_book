A poignant scene unfolds on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting showcases a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow near a tranquil river. The Dreamer, a young man with a gentle and caring demeanor, stands with a bittersweet smile, gazing at Nastenka, a young woman emitting a mix of relief and sorrow. Nastenka clasps her hands near her heart, her expressive eyes reflecting understanding and compassion. In the background, blurred figures enhance the sense of isolation surrounding the pair. The artwork is depicted in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg.
