A mystical scene unfolds on the ethereal streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes and a heart-shaped face, exudes a mix of astonishment and tenderness. She stands beside the tranquil river, hands clasped near her heart, facing the Dreamer, a young man radiating gentleness with a bittersweet smile. The background features blurred silhouettes, emphasizing the poignant connection between them. Soft shades of blues and grays dominate the artwork, illuminated by warm street lamps casting elongated shadows, embodying hope and longing.
