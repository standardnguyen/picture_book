Amidst the cozy interior of Nastenka's home, a scene unfolds in the softly lit parlor. Nastenka, a young woman with a quizzical expression, holds a stack of Walter Scott's novels close to her chest, her eyes filled with curiosity. The grandmother, a figure of wisdom and caution, sits nearby with a discerning gaze, raising a hand to inspect the books. Her face shows a mix of concern and suspicion, hinting at the hidden dangers of romantic literature. The room is adorned with lace curtains and a crackling fireplace, casting a warm glow over the scene.
