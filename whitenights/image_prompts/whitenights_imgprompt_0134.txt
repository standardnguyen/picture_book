An emotional scene unfolding on a misty embankment near the river in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-stained cheeks and a trembling posture, gazes towards the horizon with a mixture of despair and disbelief. The Dreamer, a man with a pained expression and clenched fists, stands a few steps away, heartbroken by what he must convey. The background is enveloped in a soft haze, with dimly lit street lamps casting a somber glow, highlighting the tension and sorrow between the two figures.
