In a poignant depiction set during the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg, the illustration captures a significant moment between two emotionally charged figures on a wide embankment by the tranquil river, enveloped in the surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-filled eyes and a mixture of relief and sorrow on her face, stands with her back slightly turned, hands clasped near her heart in a gesture of emotional turmoil. Her gaze is fixed on the distance, her posture betraying a sense of vulnerability and desperation. Beside her stands the Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle, caring aura and a bittersweet smile, his features reflecting a blend of concern and helplessness. The Dreamer's eyes convey a profound depth of emotion as he confronts Nastenka's shattered hope.

The scene is bathed in soft hues of blues and grays, with the gentle glows from nearby street lamps casting elongated shadows that symbolize the delicate balance between hope and despair. The setting encapsulates the emotional intensity of the narrative as Nastenka's last hope is shattered, leaving an air of melancholy and resignation hanging over the serene streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights.
