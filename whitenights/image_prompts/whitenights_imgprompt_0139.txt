An emotional scene unfolds under the surreal light of St. Petersburg's white nights. The setting is a peaceful embankment beside the river, aglow with twilight hues. The Dreamer, a young man with a look of intense emotion, stands facing Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks, who clasps his hand in surprise. The Dreamer's expression is one of inner turmoil and earnest confession. Nastenka, with a mix of astonishment and curiosity in her eyes, dries her tears, her face reflecting a complex array of emotions. The background features dimly lit street lamps casting gentle glows around them, enhancing the intimate and poignant atmosphere.
