In a dream-like setting by the Neva River in St. Petersburg during the white nights, Nastenka, a young woman with a gentle expression and thoughtful gaze, stands beside the Dreamer, a young man exuding empathy and understanding. Nastenka, with her hands clasped near her heart, looks into the distance with a mix of contemplation and longing. The Dreamer, with a soft smile and compassionate eyes, stands beside her, exuding a sense of shared introspection. The background features serene waters reflecting the soft moonlight, enhancing the ethereal atmosphere of their conversation.
