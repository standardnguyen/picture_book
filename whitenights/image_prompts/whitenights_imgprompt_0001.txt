A mystical scene on the ethereal streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting is a wide embankment beside a river, bathed in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes and a troubled expression, stands facing the Dreamer, who has a gentle, caring demeanor and a bittersweet smile. Nastenka's hands are clasped near her heart, while the Dreamer looks at her with understanding. The background features blurred figures, emphasizing the isolation of the pair, under the starry, bright sky symbolizing hope and youth. The scene is depicted in soft blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting long shadows, reflecting the sentimentality and melancholy of the moment.
