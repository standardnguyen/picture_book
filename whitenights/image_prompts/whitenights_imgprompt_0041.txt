A whimsical scene unfolds on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting features a tranquil embankment by the river, illuminated by a dreamy twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes radiating both kindness and melancholy, stands slightly turned away, her hands delicately clasped near her heart. Beside her, the Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring aura, gazes at Nastenka with a bittersweet smile. The background showcases blurred figures, emphasizing the isolation of the pair in their intimate moment. The illustration is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a blend of hope and contemplation.
