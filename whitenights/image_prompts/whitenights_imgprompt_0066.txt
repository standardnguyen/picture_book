A whimsical scene unfolds on the otherworldly streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting showcases a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow alongside a tranquil river. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes radiating a mix of relief and sorrow, stands with her hands clasped near her heart, slightly turning away from the Dreamerâ€”a young man exuding a gentle and caring aura, wearing a bittersweet smile. Blurred figures in the background accentuate the isolation surrounding the pair. The illustration, rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, captures warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg.
