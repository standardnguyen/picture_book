In a mystical setting on the dreamlike streets of St. Petersburg during the luminous white nights, Nastenka, a young woman with eyes reflecting a mix of emotions, stands on a wide embankment by the river. Her hands clasped near her heart, she gazes away from the Dreamer, a gentle young man with a caring expression and a touch of melancholy. The background features blurred silhouettes, enhancing the intimate isolation of the pair. The scene is enveloped in soft blues and grays, illuminated by the warm glows of street lamps casting long shadows, encapsulating feelings of longing and bittersweet longing.
