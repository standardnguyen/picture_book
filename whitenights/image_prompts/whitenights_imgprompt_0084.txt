A quaint illustration depicting a charming wooden house with three windows and a little upper storey, embodying an air of history and simplicity. The house is aged like the grandmother, with weather-worn wooden panels and a small garden filled with wildflowers. In the upper storey, a new lodger is moving inâ€”a young man, a stranger to the area. He is portrayed as tall and lean, carrying a modest bag of belongings. Nastenka, with a look of curiosity and anticipation, stands near the entrance, assisting the lodger. The scene is set under the soft light of a setting sun, casting warm hues on the scene, symbolizing the start of a new chapter.
