In a serene and contemplative moment under the magical skies of St. Petersburg during the white nights, a young woman named Nastenka gazes into the distance with a dreamy expression, her hands delicately touching her heart. Beside her, the Dreamer, a gentle young man named Alexei with a thoughtful smile, leans in to share a story. The setting is a tranquil embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow, with blurred figures in the background emphasizing the intimacy of the scene. Soft hues of blues and grays envelop the illustration, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, capturing the essence of wistful dreams and meaningful connections.
