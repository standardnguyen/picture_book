A charming scene set outside a vintage theater in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with a radiant smile and eager eyes, stands beside the Dreamer, a young man with a look of delight and gratitude. The theater entrance is adorned with ornate details and a marquee displaying "The Barber of Seville." In the background, Nastenka's grandmother, a kindly elderly woman with a cane, stands with a joyful expression. They are dressed in their finest attire, adding a touch of elegance. The setting is illuminated by the warm glow of street lamps, enhancing the anticipation and excitement in the air.
