A poignant scene on a misty embankment in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks and a fragile smile, leans against the railing, her face veiled with anguish and despair. Her hands grip the iron bars tightly, expressing her inner turmoil. The Dreamer, a young man with a compassionate gaze and a furrowed brow, stands a few steps away, aching to console her. The atmosphere is filled with a sense of heart-wrenching sadness, emphasized by the dimly lit street lamps casting shadows around them, mirroring the emotional weight of the moment.
