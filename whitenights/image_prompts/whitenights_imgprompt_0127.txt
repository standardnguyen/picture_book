A poignant moment in a secluded park in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks and a quivering chin, stands under a solitary lamppost, her hands clasped tightly in front of her, her expression a mix of sadness and attempted composure. The Dreamer, a young man with a compassionate gaze and a hint of melancholy in his eyes, stands a slight distance away, observing her with a gentle expression. The background is adorned with soft moonlight filtering through the trees, casting emotional silhouettes around the pair, capturing the unspoken turmoil and connection between them.
