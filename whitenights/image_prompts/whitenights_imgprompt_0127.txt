The illustration captures a tender moment on the wide embankment in St. Petersburg during the serene white nights. Nastenka, with tear-streaked cheeks and a tremble in her chin, attempts to put on a brave smile, her delicate features reflecting a mixture of emotional turmoil and affection. Her posture conveys a sense of vulnerability and inner struggle, with her bosom gently rising and falling. The Dreamer stands beside her, emanating a soothing presence, his expression tinged with concern and understanding as he observes her quiet distress. The background is bathed in soft moonlight, casting a tranquil glow over the scene. Soft shades of blues and grays dominate the color palette, accentuating the emotional depth of the moment. This poignant image encapsulates Nastenka's internal conflict and the Dreamer's empathetic response against the backdrop of the enchanting white nights.
