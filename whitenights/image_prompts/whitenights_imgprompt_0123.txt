An intimate moment captured on a misty evening along the tranquil streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with a wistful expression, stands slightly apart from the Dreamer, a thoughtful man with a hint of tenderness in his eyes. Nastenka's hands are clasped together, and her gaze is fixed on the distance, embodying a mix of yearning and playfulness. The Dreamer listens attentively, his posture reflecting a sense of quiet understanding. Soft streetlights illuminate the scene, casting a gentle glow on their figures, while the distant sound of a bell adds a touch of melancholy to the atmosphere.
