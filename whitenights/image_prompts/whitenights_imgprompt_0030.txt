A poignant illustration capturing the emotional depth of a moment on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene unfolds on a wide embankment beside a river, enveloped in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes and a look of gentle determination, stands facing the Dreamer, her hand extended in friendship, while emphasizing the condition that he must not fall in love. The Dreamer, a young man exuding sincerity and passion, grips Nastenka's hand firmly, his eyes reflecting a mixture of understanding and longing. The background is softly blurred, enhancing the intimacy of the interaction, with subtle hints of distant figures. The color palette consists of muted blues and grays, with warm street lamp glows casting delicate shadows, reflecting both vulnerability and strength in the moment.
