A dreamy scene unfolds on the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The setting showcases a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow near a tranquil river. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring aura, stands with a bittersweet smile, gazing at Nastenka, a young woman emitting a mix of relief and sorrow. Nastenka clasps her hands near her heart, her expressive eyes reflecting understanding and compassion. Both figures are positioned slightly turned away from each other, symbolizing the inner turmoil they experience. In the background, blurred figures enhance the sense of isolation surrounding the pair. Soft hues of blues and grays dominate the color palette, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, echoing the delicate dance between longing and nostalgia during the captivating white nights of St. Petersburg.
