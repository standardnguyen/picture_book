A whimsical scene captures the Dreamer, his face expressing a mix of vexation and meditative contemplation, walking briskly along the ethereal streets of St. Petersburg under the enchanting white nights. Passersby smile and turn to watch him, while a little girl, startled, laughs at his broad, thoughtful smile and gestures. The background features a blend of old women, onlookers, and laughing children, along with peasants on their barges on the Fontanka River, all woven fancifully into the scene. Soft twilight hues of blues and grays dominate the illustration, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, enhancing the playful and whimsical mood of the moment.
