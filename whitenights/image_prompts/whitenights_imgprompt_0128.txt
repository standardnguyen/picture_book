The Dreamer listens attentively, his demeanor conveying empathy and warmth, his features soft yet earnest. The background features soft hues of blues and grays, with distant street lamps casting a gentle glow that highlights the emotional intensity of the scene. The quietude of the setting enhances the emotional depth of the characters' interaction, as they navigate complex feelings of love, self-worth, and understanding amidst the enchanting backdrop of the white nights.
