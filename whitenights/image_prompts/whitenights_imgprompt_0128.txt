A contemplative scene on a tranquil path near the Neva River during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with sorrowful eyes and a faint smile, stands slightly turned away from the Dreamer, a young man exuding compassion and understanding. Nastenka's hands are clasped gently near her heart as she expresses gratitude towards the Dreamer. The Dreamer looks at her with gentle eyes, listening attentively. The background depicts blurred figures symbolizing their emotional isolation, illuminated by a soft twilight glow. The setting conveys a mix of longing, admiration, and unspoken emotions through their subtle gestures and expressions.
