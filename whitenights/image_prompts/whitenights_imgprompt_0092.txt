A quiet scene on the staircase of a quaint St. Petersburg building during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with a wistful expression, stands with a slight tension in her posture, holding a book close to her chest. The Dreamer, a young man with a friendly smile and warm eyes, stands a few steps below, looking up at her with a greeting. Their eyes meet in a brief moment of connection amidst the hushed ambiance. The setting is dimly lit by a flickering candle on a nearby table, casting shadows and highlights on their faces.
