A poignant scene under the soft moonlight by the Neva River in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks and a fragile smile, looks up with a mix of resignation and hope in her eyes. She stands facing the Dreamer, a young man exuding quiet strength and assurance, a serene expression on his face. Nastenka's hands are clasped near her heart, her posture showing a hint of vulnerability. The background features shimmering reflections on the tranquil river, enhancing the emotional depth of the moment.
