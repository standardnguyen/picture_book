On a tranquil river embankment under the serene glow of the White Nights in St. Petersburg, the illustration captures a poignant moment between two figures immersed in emotions. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes shining with traces of both relief and sorrow, stands with her back slightly turned, her hands clasped near her heart. She appears contemplative yet hopeful, her face lifted upward with a sense of resignation mingled with anticipation. Beside her stands the Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle, caring aura underscored by a bittersweet smile. His presence conveys a reassuring demeanor, emanating warmth and understanding. The background hints at distant figures, subtly blurred to enhance the focus on the central pair. Soft hues of blues and grays dominate the scene, complemented by gentle glows from nearby street lamps casting elongated shadows. The setting symbolizes a delicate balance between hope and melancholy, capturing the essence of their unspoken connection and the anticipation of their forthcoming reunion.
