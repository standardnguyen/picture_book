A melancholic scene set on a bustling street in St. Petersburg during the exodus to summer villas. The background is filled with blurred figures of well-dressed individuals, each carrying a sense of urgency and departure. The Dreamer, a young man with a furrowed brow and a wistful gaze, observes the passing crowd with a mix of resignation and longing. His posture hints at a feeling of being left behind, disconnected from the collective anticipation of escaping to summer retreats. The color scheme consists of muted tones of blues and greens, reflecting the Dreamer's somber mood amid the transient nature of the city.
