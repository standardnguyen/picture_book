A whimsical and somber illustration set in the mystical ambiance of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene unfolds on a wide embankment beside a tranquil river, bathed in a surreal twilight glow. An expressive young woman, embodying relief and sorrow, stands with hands clasped near her heart, casting a sorrowful gaze away from a gentle, caring young man with a bittersweet smile. The background is populated by blurred figures, emphasizing the isolated connection between the two. Soft shades of blues and grays dominate the artwork, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, evoking emotions of hope and melancholy.
