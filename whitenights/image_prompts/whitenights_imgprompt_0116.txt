A poignant moment captured under the soft moonlight in a secluded corner of St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with tearful eyes and a trembling smile, stands facing away from the Dreamer, a compassionate young man with an expression of unspoken love and quiet acceptance. Nastenka clutches a locket close to her heart, her figure illuminated by the gentle glow of a nearby lantern. The scene exudes a sense of bittersweet realization and the weight of unfulfilled longing, with shadows enveloping the pair in a tender embrace.
