A scene unfolds on the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the magical white nights. The setting is a wide embankment by the river, bathed in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes reflecting a mix of relief and sorrow, stands slighted away, delicately clasping her hands near her heart. Beside her, the Dreamer, a young man exuding gentleness, gazes with a bittersweet smile. The background features blurred figures, enhancing the isolation of the pair. Soft blues and grays dominate, with warm street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a blend of hope and melancholy.
