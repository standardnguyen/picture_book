An emotional moment captured in a dreamlike scene on the mystical embankment of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The Dreamer, a young man with a vulnerable yet contemplative expression and a hint of solitude, stands facing Nastenka, a young woman radiating a mix of curiosity and empathy, clasping her hands near her heart. Nastenka is slightly turned towards the Dreamer, seeking understanding. The background features blurred silhouettes, emphasizing their isolated connection. The illustration is bathed in soft blues and grays, with warm street lamp glows casting elongated shadows, symbolizing introspection and longing.
