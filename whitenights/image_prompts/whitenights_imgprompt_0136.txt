A poignant illustration capturing the raw emotions of a heartbroken Nastenka on a misty embankment near the river in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, with tear-stained cheeks and clenched fists, stands facing away from the Dreamer, her posture conveying a mix of despair, desperation, and anger. Her eyes, filled with sorrow and disbelief, search the horizon for answers. The Dreamer, depicted with a pained expression and a hand outstretched in a gesture of helplessness, looks upon Nastenka with empathy and sadness. The background features dimly lit street lamps casting a soft glow, adding to the somber and desolate atmosphere of the scene.
