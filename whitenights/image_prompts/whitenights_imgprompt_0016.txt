A serene and unexpected encounter on the canal embankment of a remote part of St. Petersburg. The setting is quiet and desolate, with the Dreamer walking along the canal, exuding a sense of contentment and solitude. A woman, positioned leaning on the railing, captivated by the muddy waters below, her expression one of contemplation and mystery. The scene captures a moment of solitude and curiosity, with the Dreamer's song echoing in the empty space. The color scheme is subdued, with muted tones to reflect the calmness and introspection of the scene.
