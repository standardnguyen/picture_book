In the background, blurred figures emphasize the isolated connection between the two. The illustration, rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, captures the warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the delicate balance between fleeting happiness and looming loneliness in the captivating white nights of St. Petersburg.
