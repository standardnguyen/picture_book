A hauntingly beautiful illustration unfolds on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene features a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow beside a tranquil river. Nastenka, a young woman with soulful eyes conveying a mix of relief and sorrow, stands with her hands clasped near her heart, her gaze turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring aura, wears a bittersweet smile as he looks towards Nastenka. In the background, blurred figures accentuate the isolation surrounding the duo, highlighting their emotional connection amidst a bustling yet distant world. The artwork is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the magical white nights of St. Petersburg.
