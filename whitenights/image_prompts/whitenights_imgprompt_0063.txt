In this poignant illustration, a neglected garden stands as a haunting symbol of lost love and past happiness. The garden, overgrown and desolate, features moss-covered paths and wilted flowers, exuding a sense of sorrow and abandonment. It serves as a stark contrast to the once-vibrant memories of the Dreamer and Nastenka walking hand in hand, sharing hopes, grief, and enduring love. The atmosphere is heavy with melancholy, with shadows cast by the setting sun adding a touch of gloom to the scene, emphasizing the bittersweet nostalgia of the past.
