Amid the gloomy, rainy atmosphere of St. Petersburg, a sense of melancholy pervades the scene on the embankment by the river. The setting mirrors the somber mood, with dark clouds looming overhead and mist rising in the background. The Dreamer, a young man with a troubled expression and introspective demeanor, stands alone facing the river, lost in deep contemplation. His features reflect a sense of confusion and inner turmoil as he grapples with obscure thoughts and unresolved questions. The environment is devoid of vibrancy, with the absence of sunlight symbolizing the heaviness of old age and the weight of unanswered queries haunting his mind. As the rain falls gently, adding to the desolate ambiance, a poignant sense of isolation and introspection envelops the Dreamer, hinting at the complexities of his emotional journey on this third white night.
