A poignant moment captured on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene unfolds on a wide embankment by the river, enveloped in a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes filled with empathy, stands with a mix of relief and sorrow. She clasps her hands near her heart, slightly turning away from the Dreamer, a young man exuding a caring demeanor and a bittersweet smile. The background showcases blurred figures, emphasizing the isolation of the pair in this intimate moment. The setting is rendered in soft blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting long shadows, symbolizing a blend of hope and melancholy.
