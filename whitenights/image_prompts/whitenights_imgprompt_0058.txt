A dreamlike illustration set in the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene captures a wide embankment next to a tranquil river, illuminated by the surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman with captivating eyes, appears both relieved and somber, her hands clasped near her heart as she gazes into the distance, slightly turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a sense of gentle care and bittersweet warmth, has a subtle smile on his face as he stands beside Nastenka, emanating a mix of comfort and longing. The background is populated by blurred figures, enhancing the sense of isolation surrounding the duo, emphasizing their emotional connection amidst the busy world around them. The illustration is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows emanating from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the magical white nights of St. Petersburg.
