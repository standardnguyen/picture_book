An intimate scene unfolds in a cozy room illuminated by a flickering candlelight. The Dreamer, a young man with a wistful expression, sits by a small table strewn with tattered books and papers. His gaze is fixed on Nastenka, a delicate young woman with a hint of melancholy in her eyes. Nastenka stands by the window, her hand resting lightly on the frame, staring out into the night with a mixture of yearning and resignation. The room is adorned with scattered belongings and soft, muted hues, evoking a sense of quiet reflection and unspoken longing.
