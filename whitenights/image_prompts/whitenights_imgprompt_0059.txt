A surreal illustration captures the dreamlike ambiance of the white nights in St. Petersburg. The scene unfolds on a wide embankment bathed in a mesmerizing twilight glow beside a serene river. Nastenka, a young woman exuding a mix of relief and sorrow, is depicted with expressive eyes and delicate gestures, symbolizing her emotional turmoil. She stands with hands clasped near her heart, slightly turned away from the Dreamer, a young man emanating a gentle aura of care and contemplation, his face marked with a bittersweet smile. In the background, blurred figures enhance the sense of isolation surrounding the duo, emphasizing their emotional connection amidst a bustling yet distant world. The illustration is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows that evoke a sense of hope tinged with melancholy, mirroring the poignant narrative of unfulfilled longing and fleeting companionship.
