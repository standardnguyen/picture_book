A dreamlike scene unfolding on the serene embankment by the Neva River during the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg. Nastenka, a young woman with a puzzled yet intrigued expression, gazes curiously at the Dreamer, a young man exuding a sense of bewilderment and wonder. Nastenka stands slightly turned towards the Dreamer, her hands held delicately as if reaching for an elusive memory. The Dreamer, with a contemplative expression and a hint of longing in his eyes, seems entranced by invisible melodies. The background is bathed in a soft iridescent glow, capturing a moment suspended in time and imbued with a sense of ethereal nostalgia.
