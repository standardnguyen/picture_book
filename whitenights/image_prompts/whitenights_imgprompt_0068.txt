A poignant scene set in a dimly lit room filled with shadows. The Dreamer, a young man with a pained expression, clutches his chest, his eyes reflecting inner turmoil and vulnerability. Nastenka, bathed in a soft glow, looks at him with concern and compassion, her hand reaching out hesitantly. The room is illuminated by flickering candles, creating a somber and intimate ambiance, capturing unspoken sadness and a longing for connection.
