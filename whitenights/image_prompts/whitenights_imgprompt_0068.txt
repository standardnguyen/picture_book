A reflective scene on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The illustration captures a wide embankment bathed in a surreal twilight glow next to a tranquil river. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring aura, stands with a contemplative expression, looking at Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes radiating a mix of understanding and compassion. Nastenka clasps her hands near her heart, her face displaying a subtle blend of empathy and concern. In the background, blurred figures add to the sense of isolation surrounding the duo. The artwork features a color palette of soft blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing the delicate balance between introspection and melancholy during the captivating white nights of St. Petersburg.
