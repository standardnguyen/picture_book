A dreamlike depiction unfolds on the magical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene captures a wide embankment next to a serene river, illuminated by a surreal twilight glow. Nastenka, a young woman exuding a mix of relief and sorrow, stands with her hands clasped near her heart, slightly turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man radiating a gentle and caring aura, wears a bittersweet smile as he gazes towards Nastenka. In the background, blurred figures enhance the sense of isolation that surrounds the duo, emphasizing their emotional connection within a bustling yet distant world. The artwork is presented in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg.
