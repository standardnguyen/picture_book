An evocative scene unfolds on the serene embankment of the Neva River during the enchanting white nights of St. Petersburg. Nastenka, a delicate young woman with tears glistening in her expressive eyes, stands with her hands clasped near her heart, embodying a mix of longing and heartache. Facing her is the Dreamer, a young man with a gentle countenance and a wistful smile, exuding empathy and understanding. The background is filled with blurred silhouettes, emphasizing the emotional isolation of the two figures. The color palette consists of soft blues, grays, and warm glows from street lamps, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy.
