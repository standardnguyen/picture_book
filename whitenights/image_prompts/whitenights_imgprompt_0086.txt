A cozy and nostalgic scene inside the humble living room of Nastenka's wooden house. Nastenka, a young woman with a peaceful expression, sits by the window engrossed in her knitting, her fingers skillfully working on a colorful stocking. The room is adorned with traditional decor, including a faded rug and a worn armchair where her grandmother, a figure of reminiscence, sits with a wistful look in her eyes. The grandmother holds a cup of tea, her gaze directed towards the window as memories of the past fill her thoughts. Soft sunlight filters through the lace curtains, casting a warm and sentimental glow over the scene.
