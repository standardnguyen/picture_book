A poignant scene unfolds on the twilight-lit embankment in St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes filled with relief and sorrow, rushes between the Dreamer and another man. In a moment of emotional turmoil, she embraces the Dreamer with warmth and tenderness, planting a heartfelt kiss on his cheek. The Dreamer, visibly crushed yet touched, stands with a mix of emotions as Nastenka quickly returns to the man she loves, grasping his hand and leading him away. The background fades as the pair disappears from view, leaving the Dreamer in a state of contemplation and longing.
