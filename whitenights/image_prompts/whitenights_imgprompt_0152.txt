A poignant scene unfolds on the mystical streets of St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, standing with a mix of sorrow and resolution, faces the Dreamer with hands tightly clasped near her heart. Her gaze is distant yet filled with emotion, capturing the weight of her words. The Dreamer, with a gentle and understanding demeanor, listens intently, his expression a blend of empathy and melancholy. The background features blurred silhouettes, enhancing the intimate isolation of the moment. Soft hues of blues and grays dominate the scene, illuminated by warm street lamp glows casting long shadows, embodying a moment of heartache and realization.
