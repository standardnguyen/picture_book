In the dim moonlight of St. Petersburg's enchanting white nights, a poignant moment unfolds on a secluded embankment. Nastenka, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks and eyes filled with a mix of turmoil and relief, stands beside the Dreamer. Her hands clutch his in a gesture of desperation, seeking solace. The Dreamer, with a compassionate expression and a reassuring smile, listens attentively. As Nastenka struggles to compose herself, she pleads for understanding, her voice trembling with emotion. Eventually, she collects herself, wipes away her tears, and together they continue their walk, a silent understanding passing between them.
