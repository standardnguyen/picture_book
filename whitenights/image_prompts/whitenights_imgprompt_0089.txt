A serene and studious scene in Nastenka's quaint living room, illuminated by the soft glow of a candle. Nastenka, a young woman with a curious expression, sits at a modest wooden table, surrounded by a stack of French books sent by the lodger. Her fingers delicately trace the spines, her face reflecting a blend of intrigue and apprehension. The room is adorned with lace curtains and a worn rug, creating a cozy ambiance. The grandmother, a figure of caution, sits nearby with a worried look, peering over her spectacles to inspect the books for their moral content. Their expressions convey a mix of intellectual curiosity and old-world sensibilities.
