A serene illustration set in St. Petersburg during the enchanting white nights. The scene takes place on a tranquil embankment beside a softly glowing river. Nastenka, a young woman with expressive eyes, exhibits a blend of calmness and attentiveness, her hands gently clasped near her heart. She faces the Dreamer, a young man exuding a sense of tranquility and warmth, with a hint of contemplation in his gaze. The background features hazy figures, enhancing the solitude of the duo. Soft shades of blues and grays dominate the artwork, with the gentle illumination of street lamps casting elongated shadows, evoking a sense of peace and introspection.
