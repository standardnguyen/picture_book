A contemplative moment on the mystical embankment of St. Petersburg during the white nights. Nastenka, a young woman with sorrowful yet curious eyes, stands by the river with hands clasped near her heart. She gazes at the Dreamer, a gentle young man with a look of introspection and a hint of vulnerability. Nastenka, slightly turned towards the Dreamer, awaits his story with anticipation. The background features faint silhouettes, enhancing the intimacy of the scene. The color palette consists of soft blues and grays, with warm street lamp glows casting long shadows, encapsulating a moment of emotional revelation and connection.
