A mystical scene unfolds on the enchanting streets of St. Petersburg during the ethereal white nights. The illustration captures a wide embankment next to a gently flowing river, illuminated by a surreal twilight glow. A young woman, Nastenka, with eyes that reflect a blend of relief and sorrow, stands with her hands delicately clasped near her heart, her body slightly turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle and caring aura, sports a bittersweet smile as he engages with Nastenka. In the background, blurred figures pass by, accentuating the seclusion and intimacy of the moment shared between them. The color palette consists of soft blues and grays, with warm glows emanating from distant street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a mix of hope and melancholy. This scene embodies the essence of their connection amidst the magical white nights in St. Petersburg.
