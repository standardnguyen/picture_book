A dimly lit room envelops the Dreamer, his somber soul mirroring the melancholy atmosphere. Fading fancies crumble around him, leaving emptiness in their wake. His heart stirs with a vague ache and new desires as fresh phantoms dance in his mind. The stillness of the room nurtures his imagination, fueled by solitude and idleness. Old Matrona quietly prepares coffee in the nearby kitchen, enhancing the serene ambiance. Suddenly, a surge of creativity bursts forth, causing the book in the Dreamer's hand to slip away before he delves into the third page.
