A melancholic scene is set in a dimly lit room, evoking a sense of emptiness and sadness in the soul of the character. The ambiance is filled with a quiet desolation as the dreamer's kingdom of fancies crumbles around him, disappearing without a trace or sound, akin to a fleeting dream. The character is unable to recollect what he was dreaming about, but a faint sensation stirs his heart, instilling a new desire and ushering in a swarm of fresh phantoms in his mind. The room is enveloped in stillness, heightened by solitude and idleness, fostering the imagination that quietly smolders and simmers, much like the coffee being prepared by old Matrona in the nearby kitchen. At moments, the imagination erupts sporadically, creating a burst of creativity. The dreamer, holding a book that he had picked up absentmindedly, finds it slipping from his grasp before he can even delve into the third page, symbolizing the transient nature of his thoughts and inspirations.
