A surreal illustration unfolds in the dreamlike setting of St. Petersburg during the white nights. The scene depicts a wide embankment bathed in a mesmerizing twilight glow beside a serene river. Nastenka, a young woman with captivating eyes and a mix of relief and sorrow in her expression, stands with hands clasped near her heart, slightly turned away from the Dreamer. The Dreamer, a young man exuding a gentle aura of care and contemplation, wears a bittersweet smile as he gazes towards Nastenka. The background features blurred figures, enhancing the sense of isolation surrounding the duo and highlighting their emotional connection amidst a bustling yet distant world. The illustration is rendered in soft hues of blues and grays, with warm glows from street lamps casting elongated shadows, symbolizing a delicate balance between hope and melancholy during the uniquely magical white nights of St. Petersburg.
