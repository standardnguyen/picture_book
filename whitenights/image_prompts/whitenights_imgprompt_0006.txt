A whimsical scene set on a picturesque street in St. Petersburg during the white nights. The focal point is a charming little house painted in a light pink hue, exuding a warm and welcoming aura. The house is depicted with expressive features, almost anthropomorphic, conveying a sense of pride and hospitality. Surrounding the house are other buildings, portrayed as ungainly and plain in contrast to the delightful pink house. In the background, the street is bustling with activity, with blurred figures passing by, emphasizing the uniqueness of the pink house. Suddenly, the image captures the moment of shock as the Dreamer gazes upon his beloved pink house, which has been painted a garish yellow. The house appears forlorn and saddened by the unexpected transformation, standing out starkly against its surroundings. The scene is filled with a sense of betrayal and dismay, with the Dreamer unable to bear the sight of his once-charming friend now disfigured by a color reminiscent of the Celestial Empire. The illustration is rendered in vivid colors to highlight the contrast between the cheerful pink and the jarring yellow, capturing the emotional impact of the house's unfortunate makeover.
